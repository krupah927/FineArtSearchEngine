The \"VC\" is the highest military honor awarded for bravery in action to a British or Commonwealth service member. It is equivalent to the US Medal of Honor. During a patrol above Southampton on 16th August 1940, Nicolson's Hurricane was fired on by a Messerschmitt Bf 110, injuring him in one eye and one foot. His engine was also damaged and a fuel tank set on fire. As he struggled to leave the blazing machine he saw a Bf 109 not too far away, and managing to get back into the bucket seat, pressed the firing button and continued firing until the enemy plane was destroyed. Not until then did he bail out, and he was able to open his parachute in time to land in a field.","medium":"Painting - Oil On Linen","title":"One Of The Few","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/one-of-the-few-wade-meyers.html","tags":["battle of britain","royal air force","hawker hurricane","world war ii","spitfire","flying","aviator"],"filename":"OneOfTheFewimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$14","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/wade-meyers.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/one-of-the-few-wade-meyers.jpg","views":"20,533","likes":"64"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Red"],"artist":"David Stribbling","description":"A stunning original oil painting on canvas from the studio of David Stribbling, one of the UK's leading wildlife artists and listed at Artprice, the world leader in art market information (see www.artprice.com) and also Artnet (www.artnet.com).

Without warning, a feeling just came over me; I put down my brush and dipped my fingers in the paint to complete the piece like a 4-year old in preschool. This proved the only way I could have captured the essence of this piece, rather than with a brush alone. When we printed this piece, we used a mat-finish with a high gloss finish on the glass to give the feel of the wet appearance.","medium":"Painting - Painting","title":"Classic Martini","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/classic-martini-michael-godard.html","tags":["martini","close up","finger painting","vodka","olive","olives","martini glass","michael godard","godard"],"filename":"ClassicMartiniimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$17","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/michael-godard.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/classic-martini-michael-godard.jpg","views":"38,548","likes":"164"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Linda Woods","description":"Contemporary pear art by Linda Woods.","medium":"Painting -

The jugs that went off with their spouts in the air, got convicted of their nasty, judgmental attitudes, repented and came back to their former comrade. Now they gather to offer comfort, care and support. Originally, the two paintings were exhibited as a pair and thus told a story with a happy ending. The blanket, a crocheted milk jug cover with little glass beads round its edge, is one my mother used when I was a small boy. Comfort those that Mourn - is not a quote from the Beatitudes.

She hits and throws and, the story goes, her fast ball canï¿½t be seen, But beneath the grit and all the grime can be found a little queen. The tomboy goes when she changes her clothes and lays her leather aside, When the sneakers come off and the slippers go on, with laces carefully tied. Then the pitcher does a pirouette thatï¿½s like a curve ball she has thrown us, And with dancing shoes and graceful moves, a much softer side is shown us.

They came, every creature; they came, two by two, They all came for a ride on that big floating zoo. When they arrived, some could not understand, How a boat could be made to float on dry land! They searched for an answer, but none could be found, Because, quite simply, there was no water around. Noah, undaunted, said, The Lord will provide. Please grab your partner, and then come inside. But a few of those creatures were still filled with doubt, They said to the others, You go ahead; weï¿½re staying out. Then they started to laugh, and they started to mock The poor foolish creaturesï¿½ in line at the dock. Bon Voyage! Please have a nice trip; Send us a post card, they yelled with a quip. Amidst taunting, the last passenger boarded the ark, The door was shut tight; the sky began to grow dark. While slapping their knees, they roared at the ship, And while shaking their heads----one felt a drip. And thus, the question is answered, as it thunders and pours, As to whatever happened to all of the great dinosaurs.

I simplified the colors to bring all the attention to the colors red and gold. It was a challenging painting to complete--outside of my comfort zone both in style and content. To me, red has always symbolized both strength and mortality. It sybolizes the earth, the ground from which were created and which we will return to. Gold is my color for divinity, perfection, or high value. It's also a color of power. The circular patterns, \"s\" curves, and repeating shapes in the composition and placement of the flowers were all set to lead the viewers eyes, and cement the eternal nature of my subject. I attempted to point out, that no matter how divine our eternal natures, this mortal life will slip through all of our fingers. Yet, the divinity within each of will remain. As the bloom and dreams of our youth fade, let us remember that common mortal and divine thread that knits us to one another, and to our Maker.","medium":"Painting - Impressionist Oil Painting On Linen","title":"Common Threads - Divine Feminine In Silk Red Dress","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/common-threads-divine-feminine-in-silk-red-dress-talya-johnson.html","tags":["talya","johnson","original","tali","clothed figure","figurative","woman","young woman","girl","red dress","flower","flowers","holding","red","gold","colorful","symbolic","spiritual","inspiration","professional"],"filename":"CommonThreadsDivineFeminineInSilkRedDressimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$17","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/talya-johnson.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/common-threads-divine-feminine-in-silk-red-dress-talya-johnson.jpg","views":"32,365","likes":"319"},{"color":[" Blue"," Red"],"artist":"Ron Carson","description":"Gabby Douglas: still got off the ground, though She carried a lot for us all","medium":"Painting - Mixed- Watercolor And Oil Paint","title":"Gabby Carried A Lot For Us All","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/gabby-carried-a-lot-for-us-all-ron-carson.html","tags":["gabby douglas","gabrielle","olympics","gymnastics","gold metal","courage","inspiration","america","black","winner","london 2012","all around"],"filename":"GabbyCarriedALotForUsAllimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$22","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/ron-carson.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/gabby-carried-a-lot-for-us-all-ron-carson.jpg","views":"12,563","likes":"44"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Pam Talley","description":"A beautiful persimmon painted in oil using palette knife.

Here we can see the abandoned woman, after a period of time, being reconciled to the fact of HIS departure. She is in the \"Healing Process\". She looks much younger, more full of life, and realizes that \"Life Goes On\"....no more room for tears and suffering. ---- A few months ago one of my best girlfriends notified me that her husband left her, after 23 years of marriage. I could feel her pain and suffering in her voice. He always was the center of her Universe, he meant everything to her. I also could hear the hope in her voice; the hope for his returning to her. I spent a lot of time trying to be next to her, to support her; wasn't much I really could do for her, unfortunately. This unhappy event in my friend's life inspired me to paint a Series of 3 paintings, \"The Eternal Whys Series\", and depicting 3 different moments in a woman's life, in such a painful period. The \"The Eternal Whys Series\" is exhibited here in my Gallery, please check them out...:) In real these paintings look very, very impressive. I painted the women's body using Gold and Bronze. I opted for this skin color because I wanted the artworks to tell a sad story that can happen in any women's life, anywhere on the globe. For the same reason the women does not have faces either. To emphasize the message of each painting, and the 3 different captured moments, I used the colors according to the depicted phase. My choice of the technique I used for the execution of this Series, serves the same purpose. --- Original paintings of this series are for Sale. 18x24 Acrylic on Stretched Canvas, all framed, ready to hang.

The original wolf painting was painted with oils, which give deep, rich tones. Better papers will give you more vibrant colors and contrast that more closely represent the original oil colors than the default choice of Archival Matte paper. So be sure to change your paper selection when ordering! Original painting: Oil on canvas. Two wolves on night watch duty, guarding their territory for the rest of the wolf pack sleeping blissfully in a nearby den. One wolf keeps a sharp eye on things while the other wolf dozes briefly. Soon they'll switch places, taking turns keeping watch throughout the night. A full moon casts bright light on the wolves and snow. This wolf painting was inspired by photos I took of wolves on a trip to Montana. The time of day was actually morning. One wolf was dozing blissfully in the warm summer sun. But with the other wolf standing in what looked like a guarding stance, it seemed like he was watching over the other wolf while she slept. A night scene seemed like the perfect setting for this pair as I imagined the alpha wolf male and female outside their den, standing guard duty over the rest of the pack. The snow helped brighten the scene so it so it didn't appear dark and spooky.","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Wolf Painting - Night Watch","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/wolf-painting-night-watch-crista-forest.html","tags":["wolf","wolves","animals","dogs","wild dogs","gray wolf","grey wolf","timber wolf","gray wolves","grey wolves","timber wolves","wild animal","animal paintings","wolves in snow","winter","winter wolf","snow","forest","mountains","night"],"filename":"WolfPaintingNightWatchimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$37","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/crista-forest.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/wolf-painting-night-watch-crista-forest.jpg","views":"36,420","likes":"189"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"The Art Of JudiLynn","description":"Original painting in acrylic on stretched canvas.

It took me four years to get the courage to paint the intimidating image. Ocassionally, I would come across the photo and think about how to tackle it. One day, I decided it was time.

She has just received a letter from Aquila, her true love, and she must hurry to follow the directions he has sent if she is to free them both from the spell of the wizard, Kolraw. The sorcerer formed an alliance with Aquila's father, King Raeb, then betrayed and murdered the king and his counselor, General Menac. Kolraw now holds the families of the two great men hostage in a secret location. All this was done to coerce Aquila and Capra to take their places as puppet monarchs under the wizard's control. The two lovers refused to do Kolraw's bidding, so he cast a spell on them. Under this curse Capra has complete freedom in a lush garden, but if she wonders from the center of the garden she begins to change more and more from human to goat! If she leaves the garden she will remain a white goat forever with only a goat's mind and memory. Aquila is free to roam the entire world in his human form, but if he comes near Capra's garden he will begin to take on the form of a black eagle. If Aquila stays in the garden he will forever be a bird of prey with only the priorities of a bird. What news is in the letter? Have Aquila and Capra truly found a way to regain their freedom together and save their families? Will Capra be able to remember the information or keep from eating the letter as the spell changes her mind and body into a goat?","medium":"Painting - Acrylic On Archival Board","title":"The Letter","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/the-letter-jane-bucci.html","tags":["woman","lady","beautiful","acrylic","red","crimson","scarlet","ruby","turban","tree","trees","head wrap","myth","story","landscape","fruit","fruits","drama","chiaroscuro","love"],"filename":"TheLetterimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$20","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/jane-bucci.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/the-letter-jane-bucci.jpg","views":"11,471","likes":"80"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Brian Moore","description":"This painting entitled \"Firebird\" is the result of a number of influences. My wife and I travelled to America not so long ago to stay with some good friends of ours over Christmas. As we were coming half-way around the world for the visit, I wanted to find some exotic landscape material I could use for my painting while there. With some research I discovered Monument Valley in Utah. The amazing land formations we found there lived up to every expectation, and in the very cold dawn I got some magnificent photographs. A friend and collector of my work had been talking to me about a painting he had seen of a phoenix emerging from the fiery red clouds of a sunrise. He tried to describe it to me and I liked the concept, as it fitted with ideas I had worked with. Monument Valley was a perfect setting being just across the border from Phoenix, Arizona and with it's ancient, magic atmosphere. \"Firebird\" is a fantasy concept drawing on a combination of the legends of the past and using an existing setting to enhance its sense of reality.

I thought of the idea while watching the birds at the feeder outside my window. I noticed one day that the feeder attracted birds of all the colors of the rainbow. I thought: how amazingly beautiful nature is! I completed a series of individual studies of each of the birds, drawn and painted to scale of the actual birds, then worked at a composition featuring them all together, which is what you see here. The arrangement of birds and color can also be associated by the chakra system, with each bird represent the corresponding chakra color. The painting is also broken up into smaller pieces, which make a great set of greeting cards. ARTWORK AND TEXT COPYRIGHT 2013 ANTONY GALBRAITH (DOANART). ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The juicy quinces are a playful blend of greens like citron, French lime and yellows- the bird on the porcelain vase looks as though he is swooping in to devour the sliced half of quince. We instantly thought about the shape of a womanï¿½s hips the moment I looked at the fruit. The maternal quality of women and the strong soft shapes of their bodies. The detailing is impeccable and the shadows add depth to the painting in more ways than one. We can feel a deep and profound correlation between two things, e.g., the sweet quince fruit and its poisonous seeds. Amazingly, the juicy yellows, greens and blues mingle perfectly with the satiny red Chinese painting. There is a reassuring divinity in the backdrop that promises to fill us with the seeds accomplishment. My mind races when I visually consume this work.

The original painting was done on a hand prepared gesso panel. Sorry, but the original sold some time ago! ............................................................. Short Biography: John Silver B.A. GAC. Born 1959 in Macclesfield Cheshire. United Kingdom.ï¿½ John began drawing and painting at the age of 5 and he knew from that early age, that all he wanted to be was an artist! John is self taught and has spent most of his life studying the techniques and knowledge of the Old Masters in great detail. He is one of the very few artists who still use these 500 year old techniques, which sometimes includes making his own oil paints and mediums. His major influences being Rembrant, Da Vinci, Titian, Caravagio, Vermeer, Poussin and many others.ï¿½ ............................................................. John Silver is considered to be one of the UKï¿½s leading contemporary Canine, Equestrian, Figurative and Erotic artists, working predominantly in Oils.ï¿½ His paintings are in many private collections Worldwide, including many celebrities and British Royalty. Many of his works being produced as both Limited Edition and Open Edition prints by some of the leading art publishers. He is also the only living artist to have work permanently hanging in the prestigious gallery of the Kennel Club in London UK. Making him one of only a few artists alive today who are already in the history books! ............................................................. John has an enviable ability to capture the female form in all its beauty, eroticism and sensuality. Favouring two styles of detailed realism and his other more loose contemporary art style. More recently John has been exploring the use of light and shade within erotic art, where he is fascinated by the subtle areas of the female form emerging almost magically from the shadowy background. ............................................................. John now lives and works in Shropshire UK. ............................................................. Some Originals are available for sale.

Keeping the shadows dark in the upper portion of the painting helps to draw your eye back into the depth of the vine. Working from back to front, I started on the grapes. Keeping in mind the colors and composition. After the grapes were in I added more texture to the vine, giving it a more gnarly look.

More directly, the overall composition of each work in the series belies the simple idea of pattern by presenting an expressive, multi-planed and ambiguous picture, but still works as part of a series, which creates an inexact pattern of repetition and theme. The urge to create, and then do it over and over again, whether widgets, clothing, or floors in a high-rise, is to some degree the story of western civilization since the industrial revolution. The dress patterns embody the need for all of us to adhere to the conventions of society, or those of our particular microcosm or niche, while the introduction of other elements, in this case quasi-architectural, disrupt the patterns and create ambiguity among them, serving the rebellious needs of autonomy and individual creativity.","medium":"Painting - Mixed Media","title":"Patterns Series Number Seven","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/patterns-series-number-seven-sonja-olson.html","tags":["patterns","collage","black","benday dots","unique","architectural"],"filename":"PatternsSeriesNumberSevenimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$85","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/sonja-olson.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/patterns-series-number-seven-sonja-olson.jpg","views":"3,318","likes":"11"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Red"],"artist":"Susan Kubes","description":"Remember autumn, walking in the woods and kicking the colorful, dried leaves?

It was not as pure abstract as i had intended..the whole Stonehenge thing was really influential in the visual result. It is just hard for me to make a simple painting..whatever.The painting was finished a couple months ago and is almost dry. The yellow \"paint brush mark\" is very thick pigment, with no oil, or medium of any kind added. The blue represents the sky, the blue-green represents the ocean, the green represents land, and the red represents the sun or fire..the yellow represents the artist interacting with these elements. I have deep thoughts while painting, and my thoughts and viewpoint of the universe are expressed in each painting. My work is not a strict aesthetic vibration, but a view into my understanding of the universe influenced by the beauty of Oil on Canvas as a medium.Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in the English county of Wiltshire.The megalithic ruin known as Stonehenge stands on the open downland of Salisbury Plain two miles (three kilometres) west of the town of Amesbury. Stonehenge is surely Britain's greatest national icon, symbolizing mystery, power and endurance. Its original purpose is unclear to us, but some have speculated that it was a temple made for the worship of ancient earth deities. It has been called an astronomical observatory for marking significant events on the prehistoric calendar. Others claim that it was a sacred site for the burial of high-ranking citizens from the societies of long ago. The question of who built Stonehenge is largely unanswered, even today. The monument's construction has been attributed to many ancient peoples throughout the years, but the most captivating and enduring attribution has been to the Druids.

Sadly today 50 years later, that forest is gone forever. Now where I live, every day log trucks rumble past my front door shaking my house. The heartache I suffer from seeing these trees go by cannot be expressed. I can imagine how indigenous forest dwellers feel when they see there place of living, there home, being clear felled. Stop! It must stop now. This is violating the rights of the children and all life of the future. Tipping the balance of biodiversity causes unrepairable problems such as blue green algae, water pollution and down stream devastation. They have not got it right. The only way we can save our earthly havens is to stop now and plan ahead, down size and think globally ac locally. Be sustainable in your own countries for all life forms.

In this painting he has taken characteristics of traditional iconography and interpreted them with more contemporary styles of painting. The face of Mary was developed from that of the artist's wife and influenced by some favorite icons and other images. The colors were also influenced by iconography. Shapes in the halo allude to celestial bodies, sacred vessels, and botanical subjects; while background elements borrow from Our Lady of Guadalupe. The 8 pointed stars on Our Lady's shoulders and forehead represent her unique relationship with the 3 persons of the Holy Trinity. Her open hand offers us the graces flowing from her heart, and gestures toward the source of her illumination - a Eucharistic host, the Body of Christ, which is the focal point of her existence.","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Immaculate Heart Of Mary","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/immaculate-heart-of-mary-smith-catholic-art.html","tags":["mary","immaculate","mercy","holy","sacred","liturgical","traditional","realism","mother","jesus","christ","god","catholic","christian","orthodox"],"filename":"ImmaculateHeartOfMaryimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$47","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/smith-catholic-art.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/2-immaculate-heart-of-mary-smith-catholic-art.jpg","views":"42,391","likes":"220"},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"Bob Staake","description":"Publication: New Yorker Image Type: Cover Date: May 2nd, 2016 Description: Prince Tribute","medium":"Painting - Painting","title":"Prince Tribute","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/prince-tribute-bob-staake.html","tags":["prince","purple rain","music","artist","death","tears","mourning","cry","may 2nd","2016"],"filename":"PrinceTributeimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$165","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/conde-nast.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/prince-tribute-bob-staake.jpg","views":"4,758","likes":"5"},{"color":[" Blue"," White"],"artist":"Bob Staake","description":"Publication: New Yorker Image Type: Cover Date: May 21st, 2012 Description:","medium":"Painting - Painting","title":"New Yorker May 21st, 2012","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/new-yorker-may-21st-2012-bob-staake.html","tags":["president","obama","gay","rights","marriage","acceptance","politics","democrat","republican","spectrum of light","2012"],"filename":"NewYorkerMay21st2012image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$85","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/conde-nast.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/1-untitled-bob-staake.jpg","views":"4,340","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Red"],"artist":"Smith Catholic Art","description":"\"Sacred Heart of Jesus\" is a contemporary icon.

In wonder he brings the manger up to his view, Smiles at the baby and whispers, I love you! I love you for bringing this season of joy, I love you for growing to a man from a boy; For being our light and leading the way, For being the spirit which makes Christmas Day! You have been my mentor, my model, my hero and guide, Please continue to help me and stay by my side. I have tried to follow your teachings and give as you gave, Reminding all to be kind and that itï¿½s wise to behave. Help me to serve others and bring them your light, Especially the children, please bless them tonight! Some have so very little, scarce food for their table, You know how it feels - you were born in a stable! Bless all their mothers and fathers with a knowledge that is sure, The best gift they can give is their love, strong and pure. Thatï¿½s the Spirit of Christmas when all is said and done, Gods gift of love, that came as His Son! Then back to His mother the child is returned The Nativity glows as the candle is burned. In a wink the little old man slips quietly away Some say he goes up the chimney and climbs in a sleigh. Whatever the case, His mission is clear Give unto others, bringing love and good cheer. He flies into the night and bids us adieu Doing for others what Jesus would do!

He noted that he had seen many paintings depicting Christ with loveable little children, but rarely had he found his age group represented in such a setting. This young man closed his message with these heartfelt words: ï¿½What about us?ï¿½ Many of us have probably asked a similar question. What about me? Who doesnï¿½t love little children with all their precious innocence and charm? But what about those of us that may not feel as lovable; those of us who may have struggled and lost our way, or who have wandered paths that have left us worn and doubting our worth? Thankfully, Christï¿½s love carries no conditions and is extended in full measure, especially to those who feel lost and forgotten.

The light of Christ is given to each and it shines in their faces. It is a light that shines in a helpful conscience that teaches of right and wrong. It is a light that illuminates their path when the way grows dark. It is a light that warms their hearts and lets them know that they are loved and always in His sight.

For those who have stumbled and lost their way, or for those who have not yet found the Savior, He is there, now as always. He offers His love unconditionally, extending it in full measure to any and all who will open their hearts to accept Him. So great is Christï¿½s love that He seeks to enter even the most hardened of hearts, symbolized by the heart-shaped stone to the left of the window. But like the closed door that can only be opened from the inside, the heart must be opened from within, freely and willingly, to accept His love. As the sun sets in the distance, a butterfly floats past. It is a reminder of Godï¿½s promise of eternal life to all who will believe in His Son who said, ï¿½ï¿½I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.ï¿½ (John 10:10) Greg Olsen -

I included a gazebo with a candlelit table set for dinner with just the right view to enjoy the waterfall and crossing deer. \"A-frame\" architecture is my favorite style of cabin, and I wanted to invite the viewer inside through large scale windows. A myriad of wildlife tell the story of autumn in the mountains.

In the early light of dawn they saw the figure of a man beside a small campfire. The man encouraged them to cast their net on the right side of their boat. Though it probably seemed that such a small adjustment would avail them little, the disciples followed his admonition and ventured a try. Perhaps there was something familiar about his voice and his simple request that subdued their unbelief. The disciples were rewarded for their simple act of faith with a huge draft containing a \u201Cmultitude of fishes\u201D, so great that their net could scarcely keep from bursting! With this miracle came the recognition that the figure beside the fire was the Risen Lord. The heartened disciples came ashore, there to enjoy a breakfast of bread and fish prepared by Jesus himself. What an amazing way to start the day! Imagine being fed, warmed and invited to bask in the glow of the \u201CLight of the World\u201D. With a simple act of faith we can do the same and greet each new dawn nourished and warmed by the fire of His spirit!

Doubt shrinks us at the threshold of the darkened way, Despair creeps in upon us and is hard to keep at bay. Light now dims as the shadows grow in length Heaviness engulfs us; we stop to pray for strength. It seems we're going nowhere; life's a dead end street, Relief is what we plead for, when it all feels like defeat! The fun has disappeared; dropping out is on our mind, The test has overwhelmed us, the answers hard to find. In these trying moments we must stop and be so still That we can feel His promptings and know that they are real. Only then can we be ready to sense the Master's touch, To know He's always there and that He loves us very much! He knows just how we feel He's been this way before, He's also climbed these steps He's walked this corridor. He is our tender tutor sent here to be our guide, All wisdom opens to us when He is by our side. Earth's halls are not so dim when the Master lights the way, He reveals a \"world of wonder\" that brings joy throughout our stay. Hand in hand He'll lead us to a life that never ends, To a brighter day in a world unseen, together eternal friends.

Each maestro has their mentor And each pupil their faithful fan. There is pleasure in each performance Be it childish or complex. And we seem to enjoy the recitals most Not when judged in a contest, But rather when shared in a concert, Where every soul resonates with a music uniquely its own, A music which becomes richer As it harmonizes with that of others.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"The Beatles Abbey Road","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/the-beatles-abbey-road-paul-meijering.html","tags":["the beatles","john lennon","paul mccartney","george harrison","ringo starr","abbey road","english rock band","liverpool","beatlemania","rock and roll","rock star","let it be","yesterday","musician","popstar","portrait","all you need is love","yellow submarine","hey jude","something"],"filename":"TheBeatlesAbbeyRoadimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/the-beatles-abbey-road-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"33,365","likes":"60"},{"color":[" Green"," Yellow"],"artist":"Brian Kesinger","description":"illustrated by ink, hand tinted with chamomile tea and then finished with watercolor.","medium":"Painting - Ink, Tea And Watercolor","title":"Green Tea","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/green-tea-brian-kesinger.html","tags":["steampunk","women","geisha"],"filename":"GreenTeaimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$72","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/brian-kesinger.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/green-tea-brian-kesinger.jpg","views":"9,587","likes":"18"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Guido Borelli","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"due bicchieri di Chianti","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/due-bicchieri-di-chianti-guido-borelli.html","tags":["terrace","scenic","landscape","tuscany","wine","glasses","chairs","table","flowers","chianti","summer","shutters"],"filename":"duebicchieridiChiantiimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$26","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/guido-borelli.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/due-bicchieri-di-chianti-guido-borelli.jpg","views":"11,849","likes":"38"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Yuriy Shevchuk","description":"Lauda vs Hunt Andreas Nikolaus \"Niki\" Lauda (AUT) (Scuderia Ferrari), Ferrari 312T - Ferrari Ferrari Tipo 015 3.0 Flat-12 (finished 2nd) James Simon Wallis Hunt (GBR) (Marlboro Team McLaren), McLaren M23 - Ford-Cosworth DFV 3.0 V8 (RET) Brazilian GP 1976 watercolor on paper 45x70cm 2013 www.shevchukart.com","medium":"Painting - Watercolor On Paper","title":"Lauda Vs Hunt Brazilian Gp 1976","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/lauda-vs-hunt-brazilian-gp-1976-yuriy-shevchuk.html","tags":["watercolor","automotive","motorsport","f1","red car","racing car","ferrari","mclaren","niki lauda","james hunt","ferrari 312t","mclaren m23","transportation","sport","autosport"],"filename":"LaudaVsHuntBrazilianGp1976image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/yuriy-shevchuk.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/lauda-vs-hunt-long-beach-us-gp-1976-yuriy-shevchuk.jpg","views":"9,752","likes":"31"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Guido Borelli","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"la finestra di Sue","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/la-finestra-di-sue-guido-borelli.html","tags":["wallscape","wall","window","sue","writing","shutter","vase","shadow","light"],"filename":"lafinestradiSueimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$26","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/guido-borelli.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/la-finestra-di-sue-guido-borelli.jpg","views":"7,194","likes":"15"},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"Harry Bliss","description":"Publication: New Yorker Image Type: Cover Date: April 13th, 2015 Description: Balcony Scene","medium":"Painting - Painting","title":"Balcony Scene","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/balcony-scene-harry-bliss.html","tags":["dog","dogs","pets","love","building","architecture","new york city","balcony","romeo and juliette","brownstone","townhouse","2015"],"filename":"BalconySceneimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$85","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/conde-nast.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/balcony-scene-harry-bliss.jpg","views":"4,379","likes":"7"},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"Chuck Pinson","description":"* See special priced extra large canvases of other images at Chuck's official site. \"The Governor's Party\" is a painting drawn from the historic governor's mansion of colonial williamsburg in Virginia.

Then, like a rushing wind, a voice whispers to our heart. And through tear-filled eyes, we see an outstretched hand, There to lead us home. Though swirling streams may block our way And slippery stones betray our feet He leads us on. He knows the way, His feet are sure, And in Him we find safe passage.

Sacred Spaces evoke feelings that not only heal and inspire but also help us discover our higher selves and our oneness with the Creator. Often times we connect these spaces to physical, sanctified locationsï¿½ but, as the Savior suggested, some Sacred Spaces are not limited by such boundaries. Any space becomes sacred when it transforms our mind and awakens our soul to discover the Kingdom of God, not only around us, but also within us. For me this piece represents a divine invitation to enter into those higher realms, a space of peace filled with His love and presence. - See more more at https:\/\/www.gregolsen.com\/gallery\/sacred-space","medium":"Painting -

From attic hideaways come holiday treasures to cast their spell over the young at heart. The boxes and bows, tinsel and trim wrap you in a warm, cozy spirit. The ribbons and reindeer, the soldiers and trains turn your mind back to the storefront windows, and you can almost imagine your nose pressed against the cold, frosty glass. Reminders of Santa and sleigh rides, falling snow and shining stars bring back the excitement of a sleepless December night. Nuzzle a fuzzy teddy bear and hear the sound of a jingling bell or a glistening golden horn. Put yourself into the miniature world of a Dickens village and stroll the winter streets with the shoppers and carolers about. Toy-like angel dolls and little snare drums are found beneath the fragrant evergreen. The wafting scent of pine boughs carries you to a magical place called Christmas. All these things form the accessories of the season, the decorations that lift and cheer us, but they only reflect the light of that which shines most brightly, a humble couple and a tiny babe, lying in a manger ï¿½ the true meaning of Christmas ï¿½ the reason for the season!

As the slanting rays of the sun reflect upon the rooftops of Old Jerusalem, Christ reflects upon His life\u2019s mission and upon those He came to serve and bless. His gaze takes in the glistening gold and marble of Herod\u2019s Temple and the smoke of burnt offerings upon the altar. He was keenly aware that soon He would offer Himself up as the true Passover Lamb - \u201C the Lamb of God.\u201D Here, upon the Mount of Olives, Jesus could see the day, like His mortal ministry, coming to a close. However, a new day always dawns and there is hope and comfort in His words, \u201CLo, I am with you always.\u201D Just as He looked down upon the traveling pilgrims entering Jerusalem, He watches still from yet a higher vantage point, ready to extend His protective wing to all who seek Him.

He was a figure in popular music for over five decades, considered by critics and musicians as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, his music and stagecraft significantly influencing popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded nine platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, releasing eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and seven gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Born and raised in south London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie began a sporadic acting career, starring in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album Low (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that would come to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, with its title track topping both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. Bowie also continued acting; his roles included Major Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), the Goblin King Jareth in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped concert touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with the release of The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death on 10 January 2016, just two days after the release of his final album, Blackstar.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"David Bowie Aladdin Sane","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/david-bowie-aladdin-sane-paul-meijering.html","tags":["david bowie","aladdin sane","ziggy stardust","popstar","celebrities","portrait","where are we now","heroes","rock","glam rock","art rock","pop","musician","singer-songwriter","hunky dory","space oddity","under pressure","queen","let's dance","realism"],"filename":"DavidBowieAladdinSaneimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/david-bowie-aladdin-sane-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"10,260","likes":"33"},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"Soosh","description":"This is a print of my original acrylic painting showing little girl sleeping all nice and cozy, holding on to her father's finger, and father seeing good dreams under the patched quilt.

Prince was renowned as an innovator and was widely known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, and wide vocal range. He was widely regarded as the pioneer of Minneapolis sound. His music combined rock, R&B, soul, funk, hip hop, disco, psychedelia, jazz, and pop. Prince was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age seven. After recording songs with his cousin's band 94 East, 19-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes before releasing his debut album For You in 1978, under the guidance of manager Owen Husney. His 1979 album Prince went platinum due to the success of the singles \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". His next three records - Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982) - continued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of elements of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name. A prolific songwriter, Prince in the 1980s wrote songs for and produced work by many other acts, often under pseudonyms.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Prince Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/prince-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["prince","the artist","purple rain","celebrities","kiss","batman","i feel for you","diamonds and pearls","dirty mind","controversy","1999","popstar","portrait","funk","r&amp;b","rock","pop","new wave","revolution","musician"],"filename":"PrincePaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/prince-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"7,853","likes":"54"},{"color":[" Green"," Green"],"artist":"Linda Woods","description":"Abstract landscape painting in shades of blue, aqua, yellow and white by Linda Woods.","medium":"Painting -

He is known for playing a wide range of starring or supporting roles, including satirical comedy, romance and dark portrayals of excitable and psychopathic characters. In many of his films, he has played the \"eternal outsider, the sardonic drifter\", and someone who rebels against the social structure. Nicholson's 12 Academy Award nominations make him the most nominated male actor in the Academy's history. Nicholson has won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice, one for the drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and the other for the romantic comedy As Good as It Gets (1997). He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the comedy-drama Terms of Endearment (1983). Nicholson is one of three male actors to win three Academy Awards. Nicholson is one of only two actors to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s; the other is Michael Caine. He has won six Golden Globe Awards, and received the Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. In 1994, he became one of the youngest actors to be awarded the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award.

That magic seemed to evaporate when our six-year-old daughter \u201Cfound out\u201D about the Easter Bunny. This led to a discussion about the Tooth Fairy, leprechauns, and finally, Santa Claus. It was sad to see some of the childhood wonderment disappear from her eyes. Later in the morning, I found her curled up on the couch, looking even sadder than before.

The Nativity is a scene that has been portrayed countless times throughout history with the result that every Christian man, woman and child has already developed a very personal and treasured image in their minds of what that special night might have been like. That visual imagery is sacred, emotional territory that I have been reluctant to tread upon as an artist. The Nativity, however, remains as the quintessential subject in Christian genre and because of that itï¿½s one of those pieces that eventually ï¿½you just gotta doï¿½! Iï¿½m not sure I wanted to do anything ï¿½differentlyï¿½ with my version of the Nativity, I actually wanted the image to feel familiar. Some of my earliest memories revolve around the Christmas season. I remember receiving a toy farm set for Christmas (apparently I was three years old that year). I recall adding my toy farm animals to the little nativity set displayed near the Christmas tree in our home. Even at that young age I somehow felt and understood the magical spirit of Christmas and I was aware that it centered around the story told by that wonderful little nativity set. Thatï¿½s why I included the Three Wise Men in the painting, although not chronologically accurate, they are part of the familiar and magical imagery we have of that first Christmas nightï¿½who wants a nativity set without any Wise Men? There is one element however which I added this is somewhat unique to the traditional nativity imagery and that is the kneeling woman with the small lamp. I often feel like women are under represented in the scriptures. Iï¿½ll leave her possible identity up to the viewer but she could be the innkeeperï¿½s wife, a midwife or a relative. I simply enjoyed the inclusion of another feminine element in this tender maternal scene. One ï¿½behind the scenesï¿½ story revolves around two of the models in the painting: the woman with the lantern and the seated shepherd on the far right with his hand on the small boyï¿½s shoulder. These two models are friends of ours and are actually married to each other. They also happen to be the parents of another model in one of my paintings entitled ï¿½Lost and Foundï¿½. That painting depicts a teenage young man on a park bench seated beside the Savior. That young man is their son, Dan. Dan and our son Nate have been friends since grade school. Some months prior to the creation the Nativity painting, Dan passed away. For me this was a case of life (and death) imitating art. I can very much imagine Dan receiving love, compassion and rest in the Saviorï¿½s company. So in a beautifully strange twist of chronology and storyline, Danï¿½s parents, in the Nativity painting have the chance to offer their love and light to the little Christ child who will one day return it upon their own son!","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"The Nativity","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/the-nativity-greg-olsen.html","tags":["jesus","baby jesus","mary","joseph","wisemen","shepherds","nativity","christmas","wise men","stable","manger","bethlehem","christ","christ child","mother mary","birth","virgin mary","christian","lord","savior"],"filename":"TheNativityimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$47","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/1-greg-olsen.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/the-nativity-greg-olsen.jpg","views":"10,723","likes":"32"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Claude Monet","description":"The Artist's Garden at Giverny, 1900 (oil on canvas) by Monet, Claude (1840-1926)","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"The Artists Garden At Giverny","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/the-artists-garden-at-giverny-claude-monet.html","tags":["the","artist","garden","giverny","1900","oil","landscape","impressionist","le jardin","monet","flower","flowers","purple","purples","violet","violets","floral","path","grounds","masterpiece"],"filename":"TheArtistsGardenAtGivernyimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$17","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/the-masters.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/the-artists-garden-at-giverny-claude-monet.jpg","views":"20,151","likes":"63"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Pieter Wagemans","description":"3D painting of Hyperastrum, and Seringa","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Hyperastrum","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/hyperastrum-pieter-wagemans.html","tags":[],"filename":"Hyperastrumimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$47","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/pieter-wagemans.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/hyperastrum-pieter-wagemans.jpg","views":"7,972","likes":"47"},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"War Is Hell Store","description":"President Abraham Lincoln Portrait.","medium":"Painting - Print","title":"Abraham Lincoln","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/abraham-lincoln-war-is-hell-store.html","tags":["abraham lincoln","president lincoln","american history","civil war","army","u s","america","war hero","patriot","vintage","civil war leaders","war is hell store","abe lincoln","united states presidents","the great emancipator","16th president","honest abe"],"filename":"AbrahamLincolnimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$17","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/war-is-hell-store.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/abraham-lincoln-war-is-hell-store.jpg","views":"10,586","likes":"9"},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"Karen Coombes","description":"Shamelessly but lovingly copied from the movie still onto a wooden trinket box, approximately 5\" x 7\"","medium":"Painting - Oil On Wood","title":"Hogwarts At Night","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/hogwarts-at-night-karen-coombes.html","tags":["harry potter","wizard","hogwarts","magic","night","moon","water","castle"],"filename":"HogwartsAtNightimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$68","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/1-karen-coombes.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/hogwarts-at-night-karen-coombes.jpg","views":"15,864","likes":"63"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Chuck Pinson","description":"To sit by the ocean, feel the breeze, and hear the rhythm of the waves, is my idea of a great vacation.

For this painting called \"A Moment on Memory Lane,\" I re-created a nostalgic street from the mid 20th century, and imagined the days when time moved a little slower, children played outside, pets wandered freely, and neighbors were counted among many good friends. I imagine classic cars cruising down the lane with autumn leaves tumbling behind and parents sending children out to gather the leaves from the lawn. I hope this scene reminds us of some of the virtues of simpler times.","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"A Moment On Memory Lane","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/a-moment-on-memory-lane-chuck-pinson.html","tags":["americana","1950s","1940s","1960s","mainstreet","classic cars"],"filename":"AMomentOnMemoryLaneimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$25","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/chuck-pinson.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/a-moment-on-memory-lane-chuck-pinson.jpg","views":"9,358","likes":"75"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Chuck Pinson","description":"See special priced large canvas on Chuck's official site. See a brief, inspirational video about the meaning of this painting at : http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CVgqMJmIAvU. This painting represents the moment we finally make it home. At the end of the hard journey of life, after all the struggles and pain, we will finally experience the sweetest taste of victory. It is the ultimate reward that is to come for those who long to be reunited with their Creator in indescribable paradise and everlasting life. It is only there, in God's mysterious beauty and perfect love that we will finally reach the complete joy and happiness our hearts have always longed for. This street is coated in the blood, sweat, and tears of our Savior and all who have sacrificed to show the way for us. Going forward on the street, the color shifts from red to gold, from pain to pleasure, rolling out to welcome you with honor and prestige. And we'll enter into the most holy place, which is represented by the cherubim, drawn from the ark of the covenant, which was once untouchable, but is now opened for you. So whatever riches, whatever struggles, whatever pain, or pleasure you experience in life. Never lose sight of this moment, the moment of your journey's end, a moment worth your whole life, when you will enter into the sweetest victory mankind can ever know. \"Then the King will say. . .'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance the Kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.' \" -Jesus (Matthew 25:34)","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"The Bridge Of Triumph","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/the-bridge-of-triumph-chuck-pinson.html","tags":["heaven","christian","god","jesus","inspirational","funeral","icon","eternal life","paradise","bible","scripture","meaning","stairway to heaven","path","journey","death","resurrection","crossing over","pearly gates","victory"],"filename":"TheBridgeOfTriumphimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$60","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/chuck-pinson.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/the-bridge-of-triumph-chuck-pinson.jpg","views":"11,050","likes":"70"},{"color":[" Green"," Black"],"artist":"Nicklas Gustafsson","description":"A surreal image of a floating dark tree with roots dripping from oil and a lone raven resting on one of its branches.

On the left we see dark storm clouds and a rugged outcropping. This side represents the stormy, rocky and troubled world we often find ourselves experiencing. It reminds us of the despair and fear caused by the dark forgetfulness we journey in. We often wander with only a dim view of who we really are, where we are going or even where we came from. With His staff, Christ divides the scene in two, identifying the contrasting experiences and making us aware that He is giving us a choice between the two worlds. Coming to Christ gives us a perspective of hope and peace, symbolized by the doves, where we can now see clearly. This outlook fills us with gratitude and love which casts out all fear. Christ reminds us that He has weathered the storm for us and trod the rocky path in our behalf so that we may have joy here and now depending on what part of the panorama we choose to focus our awareness on. He is the living water that flows with pure love and carries us to that transcendent place of peace and happiness. With Christï¿½s perspective we can experience heaven not only as a distant hope on the horizon, but as our sanctuary moment by moment.

This young man closed his message with these heartfelt words: ï¿½What about us?ï¿½ Many of us have probably asked a similar question. What about me? Who doesnï¿½t love little children with all their precious innocence and charm? But what about those of us that may not feel as lovable; those of us who may have struggled and lost our way, or who have wandered paths that have left us worn and doubting our worth?

The band has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, as a more pop-oriented act, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Rumours, Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at No. 1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date, the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-selling album of all time. The band achieved more modest success between 1971 and 1974, when the line-up included Bob Welch, during the 1990s in between the departure and return of Nicks and Buckingham, and during the 2000s when Christine McVie was absent. Due to numerous lineup changes, the only original member present in the band is drummer Mick Fleetwood. Although band founder Green named the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood and McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts, as he initially decided to stay with Mayall. Keyboardist Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, has appeared on every album except the debut album, either as a member or as a session musician. She left the band in 1998 but returned in 2014.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Fleetwood Mac Rumours","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/fleetwood-mac-rumours-paul-meijering.html","tags":["fleetwood mac","rumour","mick fleetwood","stevie nicks","lindsey buckingham","john mcvie","peter green","albatross","dreams","bob welch","rock band","popstar","celebrities","go your own way","portrait","paul","meijering","musician","singer-songwriter","realism"],"filename":"FleetwoodMacRumoursimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/fleetwood-mac-rumours-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"9,882","likes":"37"},{"color":[" Red"," Yellow"],"artist":"Lucie Bilodeau","description":"A gorgeous male African lion painted with vibrant colors.","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Watchful Eyes","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/watchful-eyes-lucie-bilodeau.html","tags":["lion","african lion","male african lion","male lion","wildlife","nature","africa","dry grass","sunset","painting","feline","animals","animal","outdoors","wild","wild life","naturalist","cat","big cat","mammals"],"filename":"WatchfulEyesimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$35","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/lucie-bilodeau.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/watchful-eyes-lucie-bilodeau.jpg","views":"8,782","likes":"57"},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"Marion Rose","description":"I always enjoy experimenting with introducing a more abstract element into my contemporary subjects.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic On Canvas","title":"Abstract Bison","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/abstract-bison-marion-rose.html","tags":["bison","wildlife","western","animal","animals","buffalo","bull","wilderness","prairie","bulls","prairies","vivid","marion rose"],"filename":"AbstractBisonimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/marion-rose.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/abstract-bison-marion-rose.jpg","views":"9,878","likes":"46"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Greg Olsen","description":"A splendid afternoon having yummy cake and tea, And lively conversation with the finest friends that could ever be.

Early in his career, Ali was known for being an inspiring, controversial and polarizing figure both inside and outside the boxing ring. Ali (as Clay) began training at age 12. At 22, he won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in an upset in 1964. Shortly after that, Ali joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name. He converted to Sunni Islam in 1975, and then embraced the teachings of Sufism in 2005. Ali retired from boxing permanently in 1981. Charles L. \"Sonny\" Liston (died December 30, 1970) was an American professional boxer known for his toughness, punching power and intimidating appearance. A long-avoided contender, he became world heavyweight champion in 1962 by knocking out Floyd Patterson in the first round, repeating the knockout in a defense of the title. Although widely regarded as unbeatable, Liston lost the title in 1964 to 7ï¿½1 underdog Muhammad Ali. Controversy followed with claims he had been drinking heavily the night before the fight. In the rematch Liston suffered a shocking first round knock-out that led to unresolved suspicions of a fix. He was still a world-ranked boxer when he died in mysterious circumstances. Underworld connections-along with his unrecorded date of birthï¿½added to the enigma. The Ring magazine ranked Liston as the seventh greatest heavyweight of all time.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Muhammad Ali Versus Sonny Liston","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/muhammad-ali-versus-sonny-liston-paul-meijering.html","tags":["muhammad ali","boxing","boxer","prizefighter","mohammed ali","ali","sonny liston","cassius clay","big bear","the greatest","boxing champion","knockout","paul","meijering","heavyweight boxing champions","athlete","icon","portrait","realism","sport"],"filename":"MuhammadAliVersusSonnyListonimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/muhammad-ali-versus-sonny-liston-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"12,354","likes":"32"},{"color":[" Red"," Yellow"],"artist":"Chuck Pinson","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Anticipation Of The Day Ahead","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/anticipation-of-the-day-ahead-chuck-pinson.html","tags":["sunrise","tractor","farming","red barn","spring","dogwood","stream","wildlife","homestead","cows","cattle","cobblestone bridge","meadow","heart"],"filename":"AnticipationOfTheDayAheadimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$25","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/chuck-pinson.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/anticipation-of-the-day-ahead-chuck-pinson.jpg","views":"11,290","likes":"69"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Johnathan Harris","description":"Arizona desert landscape with distant mountains, cactus and wildflowers.

Artistic masters throughout the ages have been drawn to the challenge of portraying themes of inspiration and significance. The life of Christ is an enduring model of humility, compassion, and love. This painting is a visual reminder of one of His most comforting messages regarding the worth of each individual soul. ï¿½Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.ï¿½ (Luke 12:6-7) As I look at the intricate design of these little sparrows, experience tells me that where there is a design, there is a designer! It is a comforting thought to consider that somewhere there is a Creator who is aware of and has love for even the least of His creations. There is incredible intimacy in the vastness of this thought.

and widely known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury wrote, composed and performed numerous hits for Queen (\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"Killer Queen,\" \"Somebody to Love,\" \"Don't Stop Me Now,\" \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\" and \"We Are the Champions.\"); occasionally served as a producer and guest musician (piano or vocals) for other artists; and concurrently led a solo career while performing with Queen. Mercury was born of Persian descent in Tanzania and grew up there and in India until his mid-teens, before moving with his family to Middlesex, England - ultimately forming the band Queen in 1970 with Brian May and Roger Taylor. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 from complications from AIDS, having acknowledged the day before his death that he'd contracted the disease.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Freddie Mercury Live","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/freddie-mercury-live-paul-meijering.html","tags":["freddie mercury","queen","freddy mercury","bohemian rhapsody","we are the champions","barcelona","killer queen","somebody to love","crazy little thing called love","aids","zanzibar","rock band","rock star","brian may","john deacon","roger taylor","musician","popstar","portrait","realism"],"filename":"FreddieMercuryLiveimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/freddie-mercury-live-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"3,221","likes":"7"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Amy Hamilton","description":"None","medium":"Painting","title":"Encounter","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/encounter-amy-hamilton.html","tags":["fox","foxes","fauna","wildlife","wild","nature","creature","animal","animals","portrait","woodland"],"filename":"Encounterimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$17","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/amy-hamilton.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/encounter-amy-hamilton.jpg","views":"1,286","likes":"21"},{"color":[" Green"," Green"],"artist":"Jennifer Lommers","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Acrylic On Canvas","title":"Garden Poetry","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/garden-poetry-jennifer-lommers.html","tags":["poppy","sunflower","garden","modern","abstract"],"filename":"GardenPoetryimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$22","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/jennifer-lommers.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/garden-poetry-jennifer-lommers.jpg","views":"2,432","likes":"13"},{"color":[" Blue"," Green"],"artist":"Linda Woods","description":"Abstract landscape beach painting in shades of blue, aqua, yellow and white by Linda Woods.","medium":"Painting - Mixed Media","title":"Ocean Blue 2","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/ocean-blue-2-linda-woods.html","tags":["abstract painting","abstract landscape","abstract beach","ocean","water","surf","waves","sand","sky","blue","aqua","navy","white","beige","coast","travel","tourism","lines","peaceful"],"filename":"OceanBlue2image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$22","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/linda-woods.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/ocean-blue-2-linda-woods.jpg","views":"6,619","likes":"38"},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"Jane Davies","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Acrylic And Collage","title":"It Could Be Anywhere","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/it-could-be-anywhere-jane-davies.html","tags":["jane davies","painting"],"filename":"ItCouldBeAnywhereimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$42","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/jane-davies.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/it-could-be-anywhere-jane-davies.jpg","views":"1,257","likes":"15"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Anna Rose Bain","description":"This painting is framed - please email me with inquiries at annarosebain@gmail.com, OR - Buy the original here: http:\/\/www.artworkbyannarose.com\/collect.html#2","medium":"Painting - Oil On Linen","title":"The Perfect Evening","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/the-perfect-evening-anna-rose-bain.html","tags":["oil portrait","young woman","beautiful","wine","books","reading","couch","chaise","sitting","dress","woman portrait","full length"],"filename":"ThePerfectEveningimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$73","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/anna-bain.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/the-perfect-evening-anna-bain.jpg","views":"13,651","likes":"103"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Marion Rose","description":"I always enjoy painting from some of my favourite cattle reference material.

It means forgiving when we are tempted to be unkind, helping when it would be easier to turn away, and sometimes going it alone rather than going along with the crowd. Jesus realized this, and when a scribe said to Him, \u201CMaster, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest,\u201D Jesus forewarned him. \u201CThe foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head\u201D (Matthew 8:19-20). History is filled with examples of those brave souls who sacrificed much for their beliefs. While the true believer might not always find favor with his fellow man, he will find it in heaven, for the Lord also promised, \u201CIf any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. (John 12:26).

Her musical path changed direction after she was denied a scholarship to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, despite a well-received audition. \"Simone said she later found out from an insider at Curtis that she was denied entry because she was black.\" To fund her continuing musical education and become a classical pianist, she began playing in a small club in Philadelphia where she was also required to sing. She was approached by Bethlehem Records, and her rendition of \"I Loves You, Porgy\" was a hit in the United States in 1958. Over the length of her career Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974. Her musical style arose from a fusion of gospel and pop songs with classical music, in particular with influences from her first inspiration, Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied with her expressive jazz-like singing in her characteristic contralto voice. She injected her classical background into her music as much as possible to give it more depth and quality, as she felt that pop music was inferior to classical. Her intuitive grasp on the audienceï¿¿performer relationship was gained from a unique background of playing piano accompaniment for church revivals and sermons regularly from the early age of six years old.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Nina Simone Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/nina-simone-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["nina simone","music","eunice kathleen waymon","american singer","songwriter","pianist","arranger","civil rights activist","classical","jazz","blues","folk","r&amp;b","gospel","pop","celebrity","celebrities","portrait","realism","i loves you porgy"],"filename":"NinaSimonePaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/nina-simone-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"4,259","likes":"30"},{"color":[" Green"," Black"],"artist":"Sassan Filsoof","description":"Perhaps the toughest one day European cycling race on the calendar, Paris Roubaix: the maker of Champions and legends.","medium":"Painting - Digital","title":"Hell Of The North Retro Cycling Illustration Poster","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/hell-of-the-north-retro-cycling-illustration-poster-sassan-filsoof.html","tags":[],"filename":"HellOfTheNorthRetroCyclingIllustrationPosterimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$22","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/sassan-filsoof.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/hell-of-the-north-retro-cycling-illustration-poster-sassan-filsoof.jpg","views":"6,384","likes":"11"},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"Debbie DeWitt","description":"An acrylic on wood painting of the Penn State football logo.

He is known as the \"Demon of Screamin'\" due to his high screams and his wide vocal range. He is also known for his on-stage acrobatics. During his high-energy performances, Tyler usually dresses in bright, colorful outfits with his trademark scarves hanging from his microphone stand. In the 1970s, Tyler rose to prominence as the lead singer of Aerosmith, which released such milestone hard rock albums as Toys in the Attic and Rocks, along with a string of hit singles, including \"Dream On\", \"Sweet Emotion\" and \"Walk This Way\". In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyler had a heavy drug and alcohol addiction and the band's popularity waned. Tyler and bandmate Joe Perry became known as the \"Toxic Twins\" due to their drug abuse. In 1986, Tyler completed drug rehabilitation and Aerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Perry joined Run-D.M.C. for a re-make of the classic Aerosmith song \"Walk This Way\", which became a Top 5 hit. Aerosmith subsequently launched a remarkable comeback with the multi-platinum albums Permanent Vacation, Pump, Get a Grip and Nine Lives, which produced a combined thirteen Top 40 singles and won the band numerous awards. During this time, the band embarked on their longest and most extensive concert tours, promoted their singles with conceptual music videos and made notable appearances in television, film and video games. In the wake of this success, Tyler emerged as one of the most enduring rock icons. Since the late 1980s, he has embarked on several solo endeavors including guest appearances on other artists' music (working with artists as diverse as Alice Cooper, Santana, Pink and Keith Anderson), film and TV roles (including as a judge on American Idol and several cameo and guest appearances in other programs and films), authoring a bestselling book and solo work (including the Top 40 hit single \"(It) Feels So Good\" in 2011). While tension with his Aerosmith bandmates boiled in 2009 and 2010 after he fell off the stage at a concert, had a relapse with prescription drugs (which he successfully received treatment for in 2009), and signed on to American Idol without telling his bandmates, Tyler has continued to record music and perform with Aerosmith, after more than 46 years in the band. In May 2015, Tyler released the country single \"Love Is Your Name\", followed by the second single \"Red, White & You\" in January 2016; his debut solo album, We're All Somebody from Somewhere, was released on July 15, 2016. Tyler is included among Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Singers. He was ranked third on Hit Parader's Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Aerosmith and in 2013, Tyler and his songwriting partner Joe Perry received the ASCAP Founders Award and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Steven Tyler 3","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/steven-tyler-3-paul-meijering.html","tags":["steven tyler","aerosmith","demon of screamin","cryin","love in an elevator","walk this way","sweet emotion","toys in the attic","pump","get a grip","sex symbol","drugs","meijering","musician","singer-songwriter","popstar","portrait","realism","band","guitarist"],"filename":"StevenTyler3image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/steven-tyler-of-aerosmith-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"4,826","likes":"7"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Amy Hamilton","description":"None","medium":"Painting","title":"Humpback Whale","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/humpback-whale-amy-hamilton.html","tags":["whale","whales","humpback","blue","ocean","sea","wildlife","wild","creature","fauna","animal","animals"],"filename":"HumpbackWhaleimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$17","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/amy-hamilton.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/humpback-whale-amy-hamilton.jpg","views":"818","likes":"8"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Amy Hamilton","description":"None","medium":"Painting","title":"Elephant","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/elephant-amy-hamilton.html","tags":["elephant","elephants","nature","animals","animal","wildlife","wild","wilderness","fauna","creature","illustration","drawing","painting","artwork","amy hamilton"],"filename":"Elephantimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$22","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/amy-hamilton.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/elephant-amy-hamilton.jpg","views":"2,478","likes":"23"},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"Scott Listfield","description":"I paint astronauts and, sometimes, dinosaurs.","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Akira","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/akira-scott-listfield.html","tags":["astronaut","space","sci-fi","science fiction","akira","motorcycle","tokyo"],"filename":"Akiraimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/scott-listfield.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/akira-scott-listfield.jpg","views":"472","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"Scott Listfield","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Under The Flight Path","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/under-the-flight-path-scott-listfield.html","tags":["astronaut","space","future","scott","pop","science fiction","airplane","blue"],"filename":"UnderTheFlightPathimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$65","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/scott-listfield.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/2-under-the-flight-path-scott-listfield.jpg","views":"15,991","likes":"33"},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"Linda Woods","description":"Bold floral thank you card design by Linda Woods.

The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls \"web-shooters\", and react to danger quickly with his \"spider-sense\", enabling him to combat his foes. When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, the high school student behind Spider-Man's secret identity and with whose \"self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness\" young readers could relate.

He is known for his neotraditionalist country style, cowboy look, and being one of the first and main country artists to bring country music back to its roots and away from the pop country era in the 1980s. Strait's success began when his first single \"Unwound\" was a hit in 1981. During the 1980s, seven of his albums reached number one on the country charts. In the 2000s, Strait was named Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music, was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and won his first Grammy award for the album Troubadour. Strait was named CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 2013, and ACM Entertainer of the Year in 1990 and 2014. He has been nominated for more CMA and ACM awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist. In 2009, he broke Conway Twitty's previous record for the most number-one hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart when his 44 number one singles surpassed Twitty's 40. Counting all music charts, Strait has amassed a total of 60 number-one hits, breaking a record also previously set by Twitty, and giving him more number one songs than any other artist in any genre of music. Strait is also known for his touring career when he designed a 360- degree configuration and introduced a festival style tours. For example, the Strait Tours earned $90 million in three years. George Strait was successful innovating country music and in numerous aspects of being a part of popular music. Strait has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. His certifications from the RIAA include 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum, and 38 gold albums. His best-selling album is Pure Country (1992), which sold 6 million (6ï¿½ platinum). His highest certified album is Strait Out of the Box (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8ï¿½ Platinum due to being a box set with four CDs).

the Original painting is 90 x 120 cm and for sale The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a mid-engined sports car, designed and developed in Germany by the Volkswagen Group and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The original version has a top speed of 407 km\/h (253 mph). It was named Car of the Decade and best car award (2000-2009) by the BBC television programme Top Gear. The standard Bugatti Veyron also won Top Gear's Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005. The Super Sport version of the Veyron is recognised by Guinness World Records as the fastest street-legal production car in the world, with a top speed of 430.9 km\/h (267.7 mph), and the roadster Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse version is the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84 km\/h (254.04 mph) in a test on 6 April 2013. The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuss, and the exterior was designed by Jozef Kaban of Volkswagen, with much of the engineering work being conducted under the guidance of engineering chief Wolfgang Schreiber. Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers the ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application on the marque's official website. The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Bugatti Veyron 'beetgatti' 1945 Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/bugatti-veyron-beetgatti-1945-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["bugatti veyron","fastest car","sports car","automobile","vehicle","automotive","volkswagen","modern","top gear","bugatti automobiles","artwork","realism","painting","vintage","auto","orange","red","brown","beetle","speed"],"filename":"BugattiVeyronbeetgatti1945Paintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/bugatti-veyron-1945-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"110","likes":"2"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Amy Hamilton","description":"None","medium":"Painting","title":"Sharks -

The Original painting is 90 x 120 cm and SOLD The Mazda MX-5, released as the Mazda MX-5 Miata in North America and as the Eunos Roadster or Mazda Roadster in Japan, is a lightweight two-seater roadster with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Manufactured by Mazda in Hiroshima, Japan, the model debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. The MX-5 was conceived as a small roadster - with light weight and minimal mechanical complexity limited only by legal and safety requirements, while being technologically modern and reliable. The MX-5 is conceptually the evolution and spiritual successor of the British sports cars of the 1950s & '60s, such as the Triumph Spitfire, Austin-Healey 100, MG MGA, and particularly the Lotus Elan. The second generation MX-5 (NB) was launched in 1998 (for the 1999 model year), the third generation (NC) model was launched in 2005 (for the 2006 model year), and a fourth generation (ND) was released in 2015 (for the 2016 model year). It continues to be the best-selling two-seat convertible sports car in history and by April 2016, over one million MX-5s had been built and sold around the world. Production of the MX-5 had fallen by 2013 to below 14,000 units, due to the world finance crisis in 2008, and the pre-announcement in 2012 of the coming ND model. Since the launch of the third generation, Mazda has consolidated worldwide marketing using the MX-5 name with the exception of the United States where it is marketed as the MX-5 Miata, and Japan, where it is known as the Roadster.

He is a goalkeeper and serves as captain for Bayern Munich and captain of Germany. Neuer has been described as a \"sweeper-keeper\" because of his unique playing style and speed when rushing off his line to anticipate opponents; he is also known for his quick reflexes, excellent shot-stopping abilities, strength, long throwing range, command of his area and accurate control and distribution of the ball. Regarded by pundits as the best goalkeeper in the world (he is the current holder of the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper award, which he has won for the past four consecutive years since 2013), and as one of the best and most complete goalkeepers of all-time, Neuer won the 2014 FIFA World Cup with Germany as well as the Golden Glove award for being the best goalkeeper in the tournament, and is considered by some in the sport to be the best goalkeeper in football since Lev Yashin. In 2014, Neuer finished third in the voting, behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award. The same year, he was ranked the third-best player in the world by The Guardian. FuÃball-Club Bayern MÃ¼nchen e.V., commonly known as FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen, FCB, Bayern Munich, or FC Bayern, is a German sports club based in Munich, Bavaria (Bayern), Germany. It is best known for its professional football team, which plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system, and is the most successful club in German football history, having won a record 27 national titles and 18 national cups. FC Bayern was founded in 1900 by 11 football players, led by Franz John. Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the middle of the 1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, it won the European Cup three times in a row (1974-1976). Overall, Bayern has reached ten European Cup\/UEFA Champions League finals, most recently winning their fifth title in 2013 as part of a continental treble. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally and the only German club to have won both international titles. Since the formation of the Bundesliga, Bayern has been the dominant club in German football with 27 titles and has won 9 of the last 13 titles. They have traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC NÃ¼rnberg, as well as with Borussia Dortmund since the mid-1990s.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Bayern Munchen Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/bayern-munchen-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["bayern munich","bayern munchen","bayern","bavaria","manuel neuer","soccer","football","germany","german","goalkeeper","goal","keeper","champion league","uefa","fifa","football team","team","sport","ball","sports club"],"filename":"BayernMunchenPaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/bayern-munchen-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"269","likes":"2"},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Paul Lovering","description":"A gifted humanitarian , Martin Luther King Jr 1929 - 1968","medium":"Painting - Watercolour - Oil Blend","title":"Martin Luther King Jr- I Have A Dream","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/martin-luther-king-jr-i-have-a-dream-paul-lovering.html","tags":["mlk","american","citizen","baptist","civil rights","activist","atlanta","usa","georgia","minister","martin luther king portrait"],"filename":"MartinLutherKingJrIHaveADreamimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$46","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-lovering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/martin-luther-king-jr-i-have-a-dream-paul-lovering.jpg","views":"113","likes":"5"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Beverly Brown Prints","description":"The exquisite afternoon light that streams into in New York City's Grand Central Terminal - painted in watercolor.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, were formulated by Joseph Ganz, an engineer whose ideas influenced Adolf Hitler after he saw the car at an auto show. The leader of Nazi Germany wished for a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for the new road network of his country. He contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it, after telling him in 1933 \"This is the car for my roads\" of the extremely similar Tatra V570. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design, and said of the Tatra influence \"sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine\". In 1965, a payment of one million Marks was made to Tatra-Ringhoffer for numerous patent infringements by the Beetle design. The result is one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced, the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made. Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or \"People's Car\"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Kï¿½fer (German for \"beetle\") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybird\/ladybug). The Beetle was designed for sustained high speed on the Reichsautobahn system. It ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6 percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6 percent in 1956.[15] The 1948 Citroï¿½n 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen's own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a \"retro\"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the \"New Beetle\", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1. In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world's most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroï¿½n DS.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Volkswagen Beetle 1955 Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/volkswagen-beetle-1955-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["volkswagen beetle","vw","cars","volkswagen","oldtimer","vintage car","automobile","automotive","vehicle","classic car","citroen ds","beetle","super beetle","bug","car","wagon","economic","estate","renault 4cv","berlin"],"filename":"VolkswagenBeetle1955Paintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/volkswagen-beetle-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"997","likes":"5"},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"Paul Lovering","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Watercolour - Oil .","title":"Sinnerman - Nina Simone","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/sinnerman-nina-simone-paul-lovering.html","tags":["nina simone","american","singer","songwriter","civil rights","activist","jazz","blues","soul","r&amp;b"],"filename":"SinnermanNinaSimoneimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$42","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-lovering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/sinnerman-nina-simone-paul-lovering.jpg","views":"84","likes":"1"},{"color":[" Blue"," Green"],"artist":"Ylli Haruni","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Red House By Tonawanda Canal","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/red-house-by-tonawanda-canal-ylli-haruni.html","tags":["red house","trees","river","fall","autumn","winter","reflections","landscape","waterscape"],"filename":"RedHouseByTonawandaCanalimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$30","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/ylli-haruni.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/red-house-by-tonawanda-canal-ylli-haruni.jpg","views":"84","likes":"2"},{"color":[" Blue"," Green"],"artist":"Ylli Haruni","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Mist At Horseshoe Falls","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/mist-at-horseshoe-falls-ylli-haruni.html","tags":["mist","horseshoe falls","niagara falls","american falls","waterfalls","landscape","waterscape"],"filename":"MistAtHorseshoeFallsimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$30","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/ylli-haruni.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/mist-at-horseshoe-falls-ylli-haruni.jpg","views":"56","likes":"0"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Jerry LoFaro","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Acrylic\/digital","title":"Sands Of Time","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/sands-of-time-jerry-lofaro.html","tags":["mummy","tomb","sarcophagus","moon","egypt","desert","pyramids","giza","mysterious","king tut","the mummy"],"filename":"SandsOfTimeimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$24","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/jerry-lofaro.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/sands-of-time-jerry-lofaro.jpg","views":"104","likes":"1"},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"Paul Meijering","description":"Barbra Streisand - realistic acrylic painting by the Dutch fine artist Paul Meijering - the Original painting is 90 x 90 cm and SOLD Barbara Joan \"Barbra\" Streisand (born April 24, 1942) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and filmmaker. In a career spanning six decades, she has become an icon in multiple fields of entertainment, which earned her recognition as Mother of All Contemporary Pop Divas or Queen of The Divas, and has been recognized with two Academy Awards, ten Grammy Awards including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Grammy Legend Award, five Emmy Awards including one Daytime Emmy, a Special Tony Award, an American Film Institute award, a Kennedy Center Honors prize, four Peabody Awards, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and nine Golden Globes. She is among a small group of entertainers who have been honored with an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award, and is one of only two artists who have also won a Peabody. Streisand is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with more than 68.5 million albums in the United States and with a total of 145 million records sold worldwide, (The only female in the top ten, and the only artist outside of the rock 'n' roll genre.) making her the best-selling female artist among the top-selling artists recognized by the Recording Industry Association of America, After beginning a successful recording career in the 1960s, Streisand ventured into film by the end of that decade. She starred in the critically acclaimed Funny Girl, for which she won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Her other films include The Owl and the Pussycat, The Way We Were, and A Star Is Born, for which she received her second Academy Award, composing music for the love theme \"Evergreen\", the first woman to be honored as a composer. With the release of Yentl in 1983, Streisand became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film. The film won an Oscar for Best Score and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical; Streisand received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the first (and to date only) woman to win that award. The RIAA and Billboard recognize Streisand as holding the record for the most top 10 albums of any female recording artist: a total of 34 since 1963. According to Billboard, Streisand holds the record for the female with the most number one albums (11).Billboard also recognizes Streisand as the greatest female of all time on its Billboard 200 chart and one of the greatest artists of all time on its Hot 100 chart. Streisand is the only recording artist to have a number-one album in each of the last six decades, having released 53 gold albums, 31 platinum albums, and 14 multi-platinum albums in the United States.","medium":"Painting -

Introduced at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, the Solstice roadster began production in Wilmington, Delaware, starting in mid-2005 for the 2006 model year. The exterior styling of the production Solstice is similar to that of the 2002 Solstice concept that preceded it. Production of the Solstice was to be running before summer 2005, but delays at the Wilmington plant pushed volume production to the fourth quarter. The new hardtop targa top 2009 model was announced in mid-2008. The Solstice uses the GM Kappa platform, which also underpins the Saturn Sky, Opel GT, and Daewoo G2X. It was the brand's first two-seater since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued in 1988. Interior of a 2006 Pontiac Solstice The Solstice was nominated for the North American Car of the Year award and Design of the Year award from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) for 2006. It was a runaway hit for Pontiac, with 7,000 orders in the first 10 days of availability and 6,000 more orders before winter. Although first-year production was planned at 7,000, General Motors apologized to customers for delays and increased production, delivering 10,000 by March 1. Following the 2008 economic recession, GM discontinued the Pontiac Division. Production ended with the closure of the Wilmington Assembly plant in July 2009.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Pontiac Solstice Coupe 2009 Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/pontiac-solstice-coupe-2009-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["sports car","bolide","opel gt","coupe","car","opel kadett","automobile","automotive","vehicle","gold","brown","bronze","yellow","chevrolet","corvette","pontiac","saturn sky","wilmington","usa","beauty"],"filename":"PontiacSolsticeCoupe2009Paintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/pontiac-solstice-coupe-2009-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"196","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Johnathan Harris","description":"This is a vibrantly colored aspen tree painting of a tree lined country road in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado in the autumn above Breckenridge.","medium":"Painting - Giclee Print From Original Acrylic Painting","title":"October Enclave","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/october-enclave-johnathan-harris.html","tags":["landscapes","southwestern","fall foliage","aspen","birch","trees","vivid","colorado","evergreen","eclectic","expressive","aspen trees","birch trees","autumn","fall","autumnal","oranges","yellow","reds","blues"],"filename":"OctoberEnclaveimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$32","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/johnathan-harris.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/october-enclave-johnathan-harris.jpg","views":"175","likes":"4"},{"color":[" Red"," Blue"],"artist":"Johnathan Harris","description":"A vibrant giclee from an original southwestern landscape painting showing a lightning strike in the Sonoran desert of Arizona near Tucson.

The marque attempted to improve profitability by focusing on the lofty over-$4,000 segment, limiting sales in the depression-wracked United States.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Lincoln K Convertible 1935 Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/lincoln-k-convertible-1935-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["lincoln","mustang","vehicle","automobile","american car","pony car","oldtimer","general motors","vintage","auto","automotive","classic car","realism","yellow","antique car","1935","transportation","chevrolet","american","beauty"],"filename":"LincolnKConvertible1935Paintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/lincoln-k-convertible-1935-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"316","likes":"11"},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Marion Rose","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Acrylic On Canvas","title":"Blue Cow II","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/blue-cow-ii-marion-rose.html","tags":["marion rose","blue","cow","ii","western","livestock","farm","vivid","painting"],"filename":"BlueCowIIimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/marion-rose.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/blue-cow-ii-marion-rose.jpg","views":"8,157","likes":"24"},{"color":[" Green"," Red"],"artist":"Lucie Bilodeau","description":"An oil painting inspired by a landscape in Montana.","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Mountain Stream 2","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/mountain-stream-2-lucie-bilodeau.html","tags":["landscape","nature","wild","mountain","stream","water","flowers","scenery","scenic","painting","montana","outdoors","summer","bilodeau"],"filename":"MountainStream2image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$35","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/lucie-bilodeau.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/mountain-stream-2-lucie-bilodeau.jpg","views":"68","likes":"2"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Juan Bosco","description":"Architectural drawing","medium":"Painting - Watercolor On Paper","title":"Architectural Drawing","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/2-architectural-drawing-juan-bosco.html","tags":["architectural drawing","section plan","pencil drawing","floor plan","technical drawing"],"filename":"ArchitecturalDrawingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$23","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/juan-bosco.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/2-architectural-drawing-juan-bosco.jpg","views":"65","likes":"0"},{"color":[" White"," Yellow"],"artist":"Beverly Brown Prints","description":"A dreamy, impressionist-style painting of Manhattanhenge, also known as the Manhattan Solstice.

It was originally based on the platform of the second generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The Mustang created the \"pony car\" class of American automobiles, affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks and gave rise to competitors such as the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, AMC Javelin, Chrysler's revamped Plymouth Barracuda, and the first generation Dodge Challenger. The Mustang is also credited for inspiring the designs of coupes such as the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri, which were imported to the United States. Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project - supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months - while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Ford Mustang 1967 Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/ford-mustang-1967-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["ford mustang","vehicle","automobile","american car","pony car","oldtimer","general motors","john najjar","luxury car","vintage","auto","automotive","classic car","realism","purple","green","antique car","ford falcon","1967","ford thunderbird"],"filename":"FordMustang1967Paintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/ford-mustang-1967-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"1,428","likes":"5"},{"color":[" Yellow"," Red"],"artist":"Linda Woods","description":"Abstract art by Linda Woods.","medium":"Painting -

The car was designed by Marcello Gandini at Bertone. Gandini drew inspiration and cues from two of his Bertone show cars from 1967, the Lamborghini Marzal and the Jaguar Pirana. The Espada was a four-seater GT, selling alongside the 2+2 400GT and the mid-engined Miura. 1217 Espadas were made, making it the most successful Lamborghini model until the expansion of Countach production in the mid-1980s. The name \"Espada\" means \"sword\" in Spanish, referring to the sword that the Torero uses to kill the bull in the Corrida. During its ten years in production the car underwent some changes, and three different series were produced. These were the S1 (1968-1970), the S2 (1970-1972) and the S3 (1972-1978).

the Original painting is 120 x 90 cm and for sale Alfa Romeo Giulia is the name of three not directly related models by the Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo. The first is a line of sporty four-door compact executive cars (Type 105) produced from 1962 to 1978, the second is an updated, mainly up-engined Spider, Sprint and Sprint Speciale Giuliettas, and the third Giulia is a compact executive car (type 952) unveiled in 2015. Alfa Romeo was one of the first mainstream manufacturers to put a powerful engine in a light-weight 1,000 kilograms (2,205 lb) four-door car for mass production. The Type 105 Giulia was equipped with a light alloy twin overhead camshaft four-cylinder engine similar to that of the earlier Giulietta (750\/101) range, available in 1.3-litre (1,290 cc) and 1.6-litre (1,570 cc) versions. Various configurations of carburetors and tuning produced power outputs from about 80 to about 110 bhp (55 to 75 kW), coupled in most cases to 5-speed manual transmission. Giulia sedans were noted for lively handling and impressive acceleration among small European four-door sedans of their era, especially considering modest engine sizes offered. The popular Super version with the twin carburettor 1.6 litre engine had a top speed of 170 km\/h (106 mph) and accelerated from 0 to 100 km\/h (62 mph) in about 12 seconds, better than many sports cars of the late 1960s and early 1970s. When leaving the factory all variations of the Giulia originally fitted either Pirelli Cinturato 165HR14 tyres or Pirelli Cinturato 155HR15 tyres. The styling of the boxy four-door notchback saloon was somewhat wanting. The engine bay, cabin and boot were all square shaped, buffered somewhat by details on the grill, roofline, bonnet and boot. Use of a wind tunnel during development led to a very aerodynamic shape that produced a drag coefficient of particularly low for a saloon of the era. The Giulia Spider was succeeded by the Alfa Romeo Spider in 1966.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Alfa Romeo Giulia Super 1967 Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/alfa-romeo-giulia-super-1967-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["alfa romeo","italian car","car","sedan","stradale","carrozzeria marazzi","automobile","auto","car show","sport car","realism","oldtimer","classic car","classics","vehicle","beauty","icon","painting","artwork","acrylic"],"filename":"AlfaRomeoGiuliaSuper1967Paintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/alfa-romeo-giulia-super-1967-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"254","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Anna Rose Bain","description":"None","medium":"Painting -

The Original painting is 90 x 90 cm and for sale Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot (born 28 September 1934) is a French former actress, singer and fashion model, who later became an animal rights activist. She was one of the best known sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s and was widely referred to by her initials. Starting in 1969, Bardot became the official face of Marianne (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France. Bardot was an aspiring ballerina in early life. She started her acting career in 1952 and after appearing in 16 routine comedy films, with limited international release, became world-famous in 1957, with the controversial film And God Created Woman. She later starred in Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film Le Mï¿½pris. For her role in Louis Malle's 1965 film Viva Maria! Bardot was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress. Bardot caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of Simone de Beauvoir's 1959 essay, The Lolita Syndrome, which described Bardot as a \"locomotive of women's history\" and built upon existentialist themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Brigitte Bardot Painting 3","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/brigitte-bardot-painting-3-paul-meijering.html","tags":["brigitte bardot","french actress","singer","sex symbol","marianne","and god created woman","fashion model","jane birkin","animal rights activist","moviestar","je t'aime moi non plus","playboy","nude","beehive","viva maria","a very private affair","portrait","celebrities","shalako","saint-tropez"],"filename":"BrigitteBardotPainting3image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/brigitte-bardot-painting-3-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"838","likes":"10"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Debbie DeWitt","description":"An acrylic on wood inspired by vintage beach badges.

He enjoyed a successful career in his native Belgium and, in particular, in the Netherlands with PSV Eindhoven. However, his playing days came to an end in the 2000-01 season after breaking his leg in a match with his club Aston Villa following a clash with Ipswich Town goalkeeper Richard Wright. The Philips Sport Vereniging (English: Philips Sports Union), abbreviated as PSV and internationally known as PSV Eindhoven is a sports club from Eindhoven, Netherlands. It is best known for its professional football department, which plays in the Eredivisie, the Dutch football top division, since its inception in 1956. Along with Ajax and Feyenoord, PSV is one of the country's \"big three\" clubs that have dominated the Eredivisie. The club was founded in 1913 as a team for Philips employees. PSV's history contains two golden eras revolving around the UEFA Cup victory in 1978 and the 1987-88 European Cup victory as part of the seasonal treble in 1988. The team has won the Eredivisie 23 times, the KNVB Cup nine times and the Johan Cruyff Shield ten times. Currently, PSV is 28th on the UEFA club coefficients ranking. Throughout the years, PSV established itself as a stepping stone for future world class players like Ruud Gullit, Ronald Koeman, Romario, Ronaldo, Phillip Cocu, Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Park Ji-sung and Arjen Robben.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Psv Eindhoven Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/psv-eindhoven-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["psv","eindhoven","football","football club","soccer club","soccer","football player","soccer player","sport","sports","athlete","ronaldo","ronaldinho","mark van bommel","red","white","realism","portrait","artwork","celebrity"],"filename":"PsvEindhovenPaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/psv-eindhoven-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"142","likes":"2"},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"Guido Borelli","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Il Castello","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/il-castello-guido-borelli.html","tags":["castle","desert","caravan","donkey","water","fortress"],"filename":"IlCastelloimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$26","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/guido-borelli.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/il-castello-guido-borelli.jpg","views":"174","likes":"2"},{"color":[" Blue"," Red"],"artist":"Ylli Haruni","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Gateway Harbor In Tonawanda","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/gateway-harbor-in-tonawanda-ylli-haruni.html","tags":["tonawanda","niagara","canal","river","boats","trees","landscape","waterscape","deck"],"filename":"GatewayHarborInTonawandaimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$30","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/ylli-haruni.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/gateway-harbor-in-tonawanda-ylli-haruni.jpg","views":"87","likes":"0"},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"Juan Bosco","description":"Monarch butterfly","medium":"Painting - Watercolor On Paper","title":"Monarch Butterfly","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/monarch-butterfly-juan-bosco.html","tags":["monarch butterfly","monarch painting","danaus plexippus","butterflies"],"filename":"MonarchButterflyimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$23","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/juan-bosco.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/monarch-butterfly-juan-bosco.jpg","views":"3,109","likes":"8"},{"color":[" Blue"," Yellow"],"artist":"Guido Borelli","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Portofino Nel 2012","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/portofino-nel-2012-guido-borelli.html","tags":["portofino","liguria","perla","emerald sea","boats","promontorio"],"filename":"PortofinoNel2012image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$26","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/guido-borelli.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/portofino-nel-2012-guido-borelli.jpg","views":"830","likes":"12"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Linda Woods","description":"Contemporary brushstroke art in autumn colors by Linda Woods.

realistic acrylic painting of \"The Artist\" by the Dutch fine artist Paul Meijering - The Original painting is 120 x 90 cm and for sale Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 - April 21, 2016), known by his stage name Prince, was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and actor. Prince was renowned as an innovator and was widely known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, and wide vocal range. He was widely regarded as the pioneer of Minneapolis sound. His music combined rock, R&B, soul, funk, hip hop, disco, psychedelia, jazz, and pop. Prince was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age seven. After recording songs with his cousin's band 94 East, 19-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes before releasing his debut album For You in 1978, under the guidance of manager Owen Husney. His 1979 album Prince went platinum due to the success of the singles \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". His next three records - Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982) - continued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of elements of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name. A prolific songwriter, Prince in the 1980s wrote songs for and produced work by many other acts, often under pseudonyms.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Prince 2","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/prince-2-paul-meijering.html","tags":["prince","the artist","purple rain","celebrities","kiss","batman","i feel for you","diamonds and pearls","dirty mind","controversy","1999","popstar","portrait","funk","r&amp;b","rock","pop","new wave","revolution","musician"],"filename":"Prince2image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/prince-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"1,555","likes":"7"},{"color":[" Red"," Yellow"],"artist":"Chuck Pinson","description":"Life is a journey.

It was introduced by the German automaker Audi AG in 2006. The car is exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi AG's high performance private subsidiary company, Quattro GmbH, and is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo platform. The fundamental construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame, and uses an aluminium monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car is built by quattro GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's 'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany. In 2005, Audi announced that the name of the successful Audi R8 race car would be used for a new road car in 2007, the Audi R8, based on the Audi Le Mans quattro concept car (designed by Frank Lamberty and Julian Hoenig), appearing at the 2003 International Geneva Motor Show, and 2003 Frankfurt International Motor Show. The R8 development program began in 2004, Lamberty's design being approved and frozen for production. Production body prototypes began field testing in January 2006. The R8 road car was officially launched at the Paris Auto Show on 30 September 2006. There was some confusion with the name, which the car shares with the 24 Hours of Le Mans winning R8 Le Mans Prototype (LMP). 6-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Jacky Ickx described the R8 as \"the best handling road car today\". It is also the first production car with full-LED headlamps","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Audi R8 2007 Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/audi-r8-2007-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["audi r8","audi","r8","vw","automobile","sports car","supercar","quattro","volkswagen","lamborghini gallardo","grand tourer","walter de silva","antique car","nostalgic","brown","beige","car","wagon","economic","estate"],"filename":"AudiR82007Paintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/audi-r8-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"1,139","likes":"6"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Scott Listfield","description":"None","medium":"Painting -

While constructing and sketching what I thought might be a nice vintage campsite, I couldn't help but interject a bit of humor. Of course, when we get outside and away from the city, we're in the home of all manner of wildlife. On one camping occasion, a particularly audacious raccoon took to stealing our food. It even ran up and took some tortillas right out of my wife's hand! Recalling such a story led me to imagine a campsite where animals would come to play and invade the campsite, much to the chagrin of the campers.

He captains both Serie A club Juventus and the Italy national team. Buffon is one of only eighteen players to have made at least 1,000 professional career appearances; with 168 international caps, Buffon is also the most capped player in the history of the Italian national team, the joint fifth-most capped male international footballer of all time, alongside Ivan Hurtado, and the most capped European international player ever. He is widely regarded by players, pundits and managers to be one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and, by some, to be the greatest ever. Buffon is known for his \"outstanding shot-stopping\" and for being \"a vocal organizer of the defence and a key dressing room personality\". He is currently the most expensive goalkeeper in history, following his \u20AC53 million transfer from Parma to Juventus in 2001. Buffon holds the record for the most clean sheets in Serie A, and with the Italy national team; he also holds the record for the longest streak without conceding a goal in Serie A history: over 12 league matches, he went unbeaten for 974 consecutive minutes during the 2015-16 season, as well as having achieved the most consecutive clean sheets (10) in Serie A in that same season.","medium":"Painting -

the Original painting is 90 x 90 cm and for sale Ant-Man is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name: Scott Lang and Hank Pym. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the twelfth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Peyton Reed, with a screenplay by Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish and Adam McKay & Paul Rudd, and stars Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Pena, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris, Anthony Mackie, Wood Harris, Judy Greer, David Dastmalchian, and Michael Douglas. In Ant-Man, Lang must help defend Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications. Development of Ant-Man began in April 2006, with the hiring of Wright to direct and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had completed three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete The World's End. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project, citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish, as well as an executive producer credit. The following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd. Principal photography took place between August and December 2014 in San Francisco and Metro Atlanta. Ant-Man held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 29, 2015, and was released in North America on July 17, 2015, in 3D and IMAX 3D. Upon its release, the film grossed more than $519 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics, who generally welcomed the film's smaller stakes than preceding MCU installments, as well as its cast, humor, and CGI sequences. A sequel, titled Ant-Man and the Wasp, is scheduled to be released on July 6, 2018.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Ant Man Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/ant-man-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["ant man","antman","marvel","avengers","michael douglas","marvel comics","paul rudd","scott lang","evangeline lilly","movie","cinema","hero","icon","artwork","realism","portrait","actor","american","hollywood","superhero"],"filename":"AntManPaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/ant-man-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"1,102","likes":"7"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Tamara Phillips","description":"None","medium":"Painting -

In 1990, she rose to fame with the release of \"Vision of Love\" from her eponymous debut album. The album produced four chart-topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbia's highest selling act. Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995-1996 with \"One Sweet Day\", which remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history. Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of Butterfly (1997). In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000.","medium":"Painting -

In spite of a short-lived mainstream career spanning seven years, he is widely considered one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of music, and one of the most important figures in the revival of blues in the 1980s. AllMusic describes him as \"a rocking powerhouse of a guitarist who gave blues a burst of momentum in the '80s, with influence still felt long after his tragic death.\" Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother Jimmie. In 1971 he dropped out of high school, and moved to Austin the following year. He played gigs with numerous bands, earning a spot in Marc Benno's band, the Nightcrawlers, and later with Denny Freeman in the Cobras, with whom he continued to work through late 1977. He then formed his own group, Triple Threat Revue, before renaming the band Double Trouble after hiring drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon. He gained fame after his performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982, and in 1983 his debut studio album, Texas Flood, charted at number 38. The ten-song album was a commercially successful release that sold over half a million copies. After achieving sobriety in late 1986, he headlined concert tours with Jeff Beck in 1989 and Joe Cocker in 1990 before his death in a helicopter crash on August 27, 1990, at the age of 35.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Stevie Ray Vaughan 2","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/stevie-ray-vaughan-2-paul-meijering.html","tags":["stevie ray vaughan","srv","double trouble","american guitarist","singer-songwriter","montreux jazz festival","let's dance","in step","popstar","portrait","paul","meijering","blues rock","electric blues","texas blues","musician","realism","guitarist","concert","hero"],"filename":"StevieRayVaughan2image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/stevie-ray-vaughan-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"1,054","likes":"9"},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"Marion Rose","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Gallery Wrapped Canvas","title":"Spirit Of The Prairie","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/spirit-of-the-prairie-marion-rose.html","tags":["bison","wildlife","western","animal","animals","buffalo","bull","wilderness","prairie","bulls","prairies","vivid","marion rose"],"filename":"SpiritOfThePrairieimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/marion-rose.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images-medium-large-5\/spirit-of-the-prairie-bison-marion-rose.jpg","views":"7,598","likes":"44"},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Ylli Haruni","description":"None","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"Canada Day Parade At Glen Williams On","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/canada-day-parade-at-glen-williams-on-ylli-haruni.html","tags":["canada day","parade","on","canada","people","cars","city","town","landscape"],"filename":"CanadaDayParadeAtGlenWilliamsOnimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$30","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/ylli-haruni.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/canada-day-parade-at-glen-williams-on-ylli-haruni.jpg","views":"327","likes":"1"},{"color":[" Green"," Green"],"artist":"Linda Woods","description":"Colorful abstract art by Linda Woods.

Encouraged to enroll in acting lessons after entering a beauty pageant, Loren began her film career in 1950 at age 15. She appeared in several bit parts and minor roles in the early part of the decade, until her five-picture contract with Paramount in 1956 launched her international career. Notable film appearances around this time include The Pride and the Passion, Houseboat, and It Started in Naples. Her talents as an actress were not recognized until her performance as Cesira in Vittorio De Sica's Two Women; Loren's performance earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1962 and made her the first artist to win an Oscar for a foreign-language performance. She holds the record for having earned six David di Donatello Awards for Best Actress, the most ever received: Two Women; Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow; Marriage Italian Style (for which she was nominated for a second Oscar); Sunflower; The Voyage; and A Special Day. After starting her family in the early 1970s, Loren spent less time on her acting career and chose to make only occasional film appearances. In later years, she has appeared in American films such as Grumpier Old Men and Nine. Aside from the Academy Award, she has won a Grammy Award, five special Golden Globes, a BAFTA Award, a Laurel Award, the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Honorary Academy Award in 1991. In 1995, she received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievements, one of many such awards. In 1999, Loren was acknowledged as one of the top 25 female American Screen Legends in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting","title":"Sophia Loren 3","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/sophia-loren-3-paul-meijering.html","tags":["sophia loren","sofia villani scicolone","italian actress","nine","sex symbol","two women","between strangers","carlo ponti","moviestar","sophia","loren","houseboat","marriage italian-style","a special day","grumpier old men","pret a porter","courage","ready to wear","idols","portrait"],"filename":"SophiaLoren3image.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/sophia-loren-glamour-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"898","likes":"12"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Debbie DeWitt","description":"An acrylic on paper painting of two flamingos with a christmas wreath, gold ornaments and a black and white striped border.

V., commonly known as FC Schalke 04, Schalke or abbreviated as S04, is a professional German association-football club and multi-sports club originally from the Schalke district of Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia. The \"04\" in the club's name derives from its formation in 1904. Schalke has long been one of the most popular professional football teams and multi-sports club in Germany, even though major successes have been rare since the club's heyday in the 1930s and early 1940s. Schalke play in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. As of December 2015, the club has 140,000 members, making it the second-largest sports club in Germany and the sixth-largest sports club in the world in terms of membership. Other activities offered by the club include athletics (track and field), basketball, handball, table tennis, winter sports, and eSports. Founded in 1904, Schalke has won seven German championships, five DFB-Pokals, one DFL-Supercup and one UEFA Cup. Since 2001, Schalke's stadium is the Veltins-Arena. Schalke holds a long-standing rivalry with Ruhr neighbours Borussia Dortmund, arguably one of the most widespread and well-known rivalries in German football, and matches between the two teams are referred to as the Revierderby. Schalke was ranked as the seventh-best football team in Europe by UEFA's 2015 UEFA club rankings. In terms of operating income, Schalke possesses the seventh-highest operating income of any football club at \"$64.4 million or Â£38.2 million (\u20AC48 million)\",[6] and 0% debt as of August 2014. Schalke also generates the 14th-highest revenue of any football club, at \"$265.6 million or Â£157.8 million (\u20AC198 million)\". In May 2014, Schalke 04 were ranked by Forbes magazine as the 14th-most valuable football club, at \"Â£355 million or $599 million (\u20AC446 million)\", an increase of 16% from the previous year. Julian Draxler (born 20 September 1993) is a German professional footballer who plays as a left winger or attacking midfielder for French club Paris Saint-Germain and the Germany national football team. He is known for his ability to use both feet, his speed, and the power of his shot. Draxler made his Bundesliga debut for Schalke 04 aged 17 in January 2011, and in May of that year scored the first goal as the side won the DFB-Pokal Final. In total, he played 171 competitive matches for Schalke, scoring 30 goals, before transferring to VfL Wolfsburg in 2015. In January 2017, he joined PSG. A full international with over 25 caps since 2012, he was part of the German side which won the 2014 FIFA World Cup and reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2016.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Schalke 04 Gelsenkirchen Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/schalke-04-gelsenkirchen-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["schalke","julian draxler","football","soccer","ball","soccer player","football player","psg","uefa champions league","german","germany","borussia dortmund","derby","raul","portrait","sport","sports","game","famous","fame"],"filename":"Schalke04GelsenkirchenPaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/schalke-04-gelsenkirchen-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"353","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Green"," Black"],"artist":"Paul Lovering","description":"My watercolour of the the Mighty Frank Zappa given a twist with some texture","medium":"Painting - Watercolour\/digital","title":"Zappa","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/zappa-paul-lovering.html","tags":["frank zappa","zappa","portrait","american","singer","songwriter","musician","legend","digital","rock","portraiture","face","eyes","america","icon"],"filename":"Zappaimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$26","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-lovering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/zappa-paul-lovering.jpg","views":"1,075","likes":"17"},{"color":[" Green"," Yellow"],"artist":"Juan Bosco","description":"copenhagen","medium":"Painting - Watercolor On Paper","title":"Copenhagen","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/2-copenhagen-juan-bosco.html","tags":["denmark","copenhagen"],"filename":"Copenhagenimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$23","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/juan-bosco.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/2-copenhagen-juan-bosco.jpg","views":"199","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Red"," Yellow"],"artist":"Debbie DeWitt","description":"A pen and ink drawing of the Eiffel Tower layered over brown planked wood with a vintage map of France and text.

R. Cash; February 26, 1932 - September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author, who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. Cash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark look, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\". He traditionally began his concerts with the simple \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash\", followed by his signature \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Much of Cash's music echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His best-known songs included \"I Walk the Line\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\" and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their marriage); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\" and \"Rock Island Line\".

In 2015, he worked as a pundit for Sky Sport Italia. A technically gifted, and creative supporting forward, who was also a free-kick specialist, Del Piero is widely regarded by players, pundits, and managers as one of the greatest players of his generation, and as one of the best Italian players of all time, winning the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year award in 1998 and 2008. A prolific goal-scorer, he is currently the second highest all-time Italian top-scorer in all competitions, with 346 goals, behind only Silvio Piola, with 390 goals; he is also the joint ninth highest goalscorer in Serie A history, with 188 goals, alongside Giuseppe Signori and Alberto Gilardino.

Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The word Real is Spanish for Royal and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH (born 5 February 1985), known as Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Real Madrid and the Portugal national team. He is a forward and serves as captain for Portugal. By the age of 22, Ronaldo had received Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations. The following year, in 2008, he won his first Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. He followed this up by winning the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013 and 2014. He also won the 2013-14 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. In January 2014, Ronaldo scored his 400th senior career goal for club and country aged 28. Often ranked as the best player in the world and rated by some in the sport as the greatest of all time, Ronaldo is the first Portuguese footballer to win three FIFA\/Ballons d'Or, and the first player to win four European Golden Shoe awards. In January 2015, Ronaldo was named as the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation, during its 100th anniversary celebrations.

Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"MÃ©s que un club\" (English: \"More than a club\"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.56 billion, and the world's second richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20AC560.8 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del BarÃ§a\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria EspinÃ s. Domestically, Barcelona has won 24 La Liga, 29 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de EspaÃ±a, 3 Copa Eva Duarte and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, Barcelona has won twenty European and World titles - four UEFA Champions League titles and one European Cup, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, a shared record five UEFA Super Cup, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a record three FIFA Club World Cup. Barcelona was ranked first in the IFFHS Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015 and currently occupies the third position on the UEFA club rankings. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid; matches between the two teams are referred to as El ClÃ¡sico. Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[9][10] Barcelona players have won a record number of Ballon d'Or awards (11), with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards (7), with winners including Ronaldo, RomÃ¡rio and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, AndrÃ©s Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school. Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera DivisiÃ³n that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, completing the sextuple in also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on 6 June 2015, Barcelona became the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice. Lionel AndrÃ©s \"Leo\" Messi (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only player in history to win five FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, four of which he won consecutively, and the first to win three European Golden Shoes. He has won 29 trophies with Barcelona, including eight La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles, and five Copas del Rey. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most official goals scored in La Liga (349), a La Liga season (50) and a club football season in Europe (73), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga (137) and the Copa AmÃ©rica (11). He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country. Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008-09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Fc Barcelona Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/fc-barcelona-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["lionel messi","sport","leo messi","lionel","fc barcelona","messi","football","champion league","ballon d'or","super cup","uefa","la liga","camp nou","athlete","meijering","idol","portrait","realism","olympics","adventure"],"filename":"FcBarcelonaPaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/fc-barcelona-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"462","likes":"4"},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Yuriy Shevchuk","description":"1984 Ferrari 288 GTO oil on canvas 80 x 80 cm 2017 www.shevchukart.com #shevchukart #ferrari #ferrariart #automotive #carart #red #redferrari #ferrari288gto","medium":"Painting - Oil On Canvas","title":"1984 Ferrari 288 Gto","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/1984-ferrari-288-gto-yuriy-shevchuk.html","tags":["automotive","motorsport","ferrari","red","ferrari 288 gto"],"filename":"1984Ferrari288Gtoimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/yuriy-shevchuk.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/medium\/1\/1984-ferrari-288-gto-yuriy-shevchuk.jpg","views":"253","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Yuriy Shevchuk","description":"2003 Ferrari 360 Challenge oil on canvas 80 x 80 cm 2017 www.shevchukart.com #shevchukart #ferrari #ferrariart #automotive #ferrari360 #original","medium":"Painting - Oli On Canvas","title":"2003 Ferrari 360 Challenge","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/2003-ferrari-360-challenge-yuriy-shevchuk.html","tags":["automotive","motorsport","ferrari","ferrari 360","oil on canvas"],"filename":"2003Ferrari360Challengeimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/yuriy-shevchuk.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/2003-ferrari-360-challenge-yuriy-shevchuk.jpg","views":"179","likes":"1"},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Paul Lovering","description":"he inspiration performer singer songwriter guitarist Joe Bonamassa","medium":"Painting - Watercolour -ink -sketch","title":"Joe Bonamassa","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/joe-bonamassa-paul-lovering.html","tags":["joe bonamassa","american","rock guitarist","composer","blues","musician","hard rock","singer","songwriter","united states"],"filename":"JoeBonamassaimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$42","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-lovering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/joe-bonamassa-paul-lovering.jpg","views":"180","likes":"4"},{"color":[" Red"," Yellow"],"artist":"Debbie DeWitt","description":"An acrylic on wood contemporary piece consisting of typography and symbols in a quilt pattern design.

His primary playing positions are those of an attacking midfielder or supporting forward, although he has also been successfully utilized as a lone striker, or even as a winger. Totti has spent his entire career at Roma; he is the top goalscorer and the most capped player in the club's history. A creative playmaker renowned for his technical ability and goal scoring, Totti is considered to be one of the greatest Italian players of all time, one of the most talented players of his generation, and also, by some, to be Roma's greatest ever player. He holds the record for having won 11 Oscar del calcio AIC, including five Italian Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A goal of the year awards, one Serie A Goalscorer of the Year award and one Serie A Young Footballer of the Year award. Totti is currently the seventh highest scoring Italian in all competitions, with 308 goals. Associazione Sportiva Roma, commonly referred to as simply Roma, is a professional Italian football club based in Rome. Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for 1951-52. Roma have won Serie A three times, in 1941-42, 1982-83 and 2000-01, as well as winning nine Coppa Italia titles and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. In UEFA competitions Roma won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960\u201361, and were runners-up in the 1983-84 European Cup and the 1990-91 UEFA Cup. Since 1953 Roma have played their home games at the Stadio Olimpico, a venue they share with city rivals Lazio. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the second largest of its kind in Italy, with only the San Siro able to seat more. The club plan to move to a new stadium, though this is yet to start construction. The club's home colours are Tyrian purple and gold, which gives Roma their nickname I Giallorossi (The Yellow and Reds). Their club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the founding myth of Rome.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"As Roma Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/as-roma-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["francesco totti","sports","totti","roma","midfielder","trequartista","striker","football","soccer","stadium","football field","as roma","italy","celebrity","the golden boy","celebrities","athlete","idols","portrait","realism"],"filename":"AsRomaPaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/as-roma-rome-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"406","likes":"2"},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Mary Helmreich","description":"This is the view from Torrey Pines State Park of highway 101 skirting the Pacific Ocean at dusk.

Founded as Wilhelmina in 1908, the club changed its name to SC Feijenoord in 1912, SC Feyenoord in 1974, and Feyenoord Rotterdam in 1978, when SC Feyenoord became a separate amateur team. Since 1937, Feyenoord's home ground has been Stadion Feijenoord, named De Kuip. Feyenoord is one of the most successful clubs in the Netherlands, winning 14 Eredivisie titles, 12 KNVB Cups and two Johan Cruyff Shields, having won in the international stage one European Cup, two UEFA Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. The club have played continuously in the top tier of the Dutch football system since gaining promotion to Eerste Klasse, the Eredivisie's forerunner competition, in 1921, more time than any other club in the country, which has dominated alongside Ajax and PSV Eindhoven. Feyenoord is known as a people's club, with a huge national support. The club's most successful period in history was the 1960s and '70s when Coen Moulijn and Ove Kindvall led the club to six league titles, two European trophies, an Intercontinental cup and thereby becoming the first Dutch club to win the European Cup and the Intercontinental Cup. Feyenoord has a longstanding rivalry with AFC Ajax, as a clash between the two biggest cities in the Netherlands, which is called De Klassieker (\"The Classic\"). The club's anthem is \"Hand in Hand\". In 2019, Feyenoord will become a multi-sports club. HC Feijenoord, Sportclub Feyenoord (amateur football team) and Rotterdam Basketbal will be a part of the club.","medium":"Painting - Acrylic Painting On Panel","title":"Feyenoord Rotterdam Painting","url":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/featured\/feyenoord-rotterdam-painting-paul-meijering.html","tags":["feyenoord","rotterdam","dirk kuyt","the netherlands","dutch","de kuip","stadium","stadion","champion","champion league","super cup","european cup","uefa cup","johan cruyff","ruud gullit","soccer","sport","football","painting","realism"],"filename":"FeyenoordRotterdamPaintingimage.jpg","size":"12 x 18","price":"$27","artistURL":"https:\/\/fineartamerica.com\/profiles\/paul-meijering.html","imgsrc":"https:\/\/images.fineartamerica.com\/images\/artworkimages\/mediumlarge\/1\/feyenoord-painting-paul-meijering.jpg","views":"552","likes":"3"},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Patricia Ariel","description":"\"The Quintessence of Matter\" was originally created for the \"Beyond The Sea\" group exhibition, in Seattle, WA (2017).
