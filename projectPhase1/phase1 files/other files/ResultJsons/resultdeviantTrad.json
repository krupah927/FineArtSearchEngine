Also known as \"Tulipomania\". These two works represent (to plagiarise Wikipedia) what is considered to be the first recorded economic bubble: a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for tulip bulbs reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed. At the peak of tulip mania, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. The tulip painted here is the Semper Augustus, which was the most expensive tulip sold during tulip mania. I debated posting these as separate deviations, but they were created to be displayed together and I think need to be paired with eachother to make sense. This was a commission I completed before Christmas. It's something a bit different from my usual work, but I like when artists have several completely different styles nestled in amongst their gallery. There is a poster apparently featured in \"Wall Street 2\" in Michael Douglas's apartment where the event is mentioned. I don't know, I haven't seen the movie - but apparently economists all over the world want a poster of this event! And those that are currently available out there to my eyes look a bit underwhelming and are also quite expensive for a print. So this is my take on illustrating and depicting this event. I wanted it to look quite clean and simple, but still seem historical and Old-World enough. Hopefully it sits somewhere comfortably between looking contemporary and old. It was a bit of a challenge trying to produce that typical old botanical illustration aesthetic and approach to colour, but I think it's close (I couldn't help myself adding in a bit of purple to lift it a bit). For any typography nerds out there: the typeface I chose to hand draw is a more irregular variation on Caslon, which is derived from 17th Century Dutch Fell types typical of the era So there you are.

Bride is the daughter of the Dagda, and considered one of the Tuatha De Danann, the people of the Goddess Danu; She was especially associated with the province of Leinster, and was believed to protect the people there. Bride proved so popular that when Christianity came along they adopted Her into their pantheon as Saint Brigid, one of the three patron saints of Ireland; She was still, however, associated with fire and the province of Leinster. At Her convent in Kildare an eternal flame was kept lit.

I am old enough to have been a fan of \"Mork and Mindy\" from the 1970s and I have always enjoyed his comedy and more serious roles since then. He will be sadly missed. Acrylic on Deep Edge Canvas 40x30 inches This is a commission that I have just completed for a lovely young man from the USA. It is a surprise present for his wife, who loves the film \"What Dreams May Come\". I worked from various stills of the film to try and recreate the image that was required. The couple in the painting are him and his wife and she is carrying her favourite flowers, Calla lilies. It was wonderful to work on such a romantic gift. \"This was for me and it is BEYOND perfect. I can even express how amazing this gift is. I can't stop staring at it! You did so amazing - thank you SO SO much!\" (Message received when the gift was given.) \"As you can tell, we received the painting and my wife absolutely loves it. She said it was the best gift anyone had ever got her and that nothing would be able to top it. I'll be sure to send you a picture of it hanging once we do so. We are still trying to decide where we want it because my wife wants to put it in a place that she can look at it all the time. I just wanted to thank you for the amazing job you did with the painting. It turned out better than I could have imagined at the start and I am extremely happy that I found you and was able to have this work commissioned. It was a pleasure working with you and you made my first commission a very enjoyable process.\" (Message from client.) annmariebone.com Please like me on facebook My Facebook Page Thank you in advance for any comments and to anyone kind enough to add this painting to their collections.

The original black & white version is also available on this site, and I'll make the large, printable versions available soon too. I also have both in French (thanks to Arnaud Mousnier-Lompré's help). The map is PITT pen on various layers of tracing paper. The sketches were done in pencil on paper. Pieces were then scanned and printed on Canson paper, and painted with Ecoline ink. The background is a sheet of paper I kept in my jeans back pocket for a couple of weeks. Everything was then scanned again and assembled digitally. The font is Callie Hand by Callie Renee Roberson.

In business, kaizen refers to activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers. It also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain. It has been applied in healthcare, psychotherapy, life-coaching, government, banking, and other industries. By improving standardized programmes and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste. Kaizen was first practiced in Japanese businesses after the Second World War, influenced in part by American business and quality-management teachers, and most notably as part of The Toyota Way. It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside of business and productivity.","medium":null,"title":"KAIZEN Shodo Japanese Caligraphy carmenharada Watch Traditional Art Typography Calligraphy carmenharada #carmen #harada #japanese #kaizen #calligraphy","url":"https:\/\/carmenharada.deviantart.com\/art\/KAIZEN-Shodo-Japanese-Caligraphy-700649671\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Typography","Calligraphy"],"filename":"KAIZEN Shodo Japanese Caligraphy carmenharada Watch Traditional Art Typography Calligraphy carmenharada #carmen #harada #japanese #kaizen #calligraphy_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/carmenharada.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/f700\/i\/2017\/236\/0\/5\/kaizen_shodo_japanese_caligraphy_by_carmenharada-dbl5cqv.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"StudioUndertheMoon","description":"The collection of oil paintings \" Sea \u201D 2016 www.facebook.com\/justynakopani\u2026","medium":null,"title":"Storm StudioUndertheMoon Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery StudioUndertheMoon #marine #painting #sea #seascape #storm","url":"https:\/\/studiounderthemoon.deviantart.com\/art\/Storm-646366076\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Landscapes & Scenery"],"filename":"Storm StudioUndertheMoon Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery StudioUndertheMoon #marine #painting #sea #seascape #storm_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/studiounderthemoon.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/5ab6\/th\/pre\/i\/2016\/322\/6\/5\/storm_by_studiounderthemoon-daotv98.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"agnes-cecile","description":"_never talk about it. watercolor, charcoal, ink.","medium":null,"title":"non parlarne mai agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Abstract agnes-cecile","url":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/art\/non-parlarne-mai-190095981\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Abstract"],"filename":"non parlarne mai agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Abstract agnes-cecile_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$55.75","artistURL":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/dcde\/f\/2010\/353\/e\/f\/non_parlarne_mai_by_agnes_cecile-d356ezx.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"agnes-cecile","description":"> open parenthesis, close parenthesis I'm just a parenthesis in your life, here I've started, here I've finished. acrylic, watercolor, charcoal, pencil and pen on canvas 120cm x 80cm YOUTUBE | TUMBLR | FACEBOOK","medium":null,"title":"( ) agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal agnes-cecile","url":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/art\/--460309621\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Surreal"],"filename":"( ) agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal agnes-cecile_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$55.75","artistURL":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/9c6b\/f\/2014\/163\/2\/1\/parentesi_1_pic_by_agnes_cecile-d7m216d.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Melonkitten","description":"hello I felt like drawing blueberries have a nice day Van Gogh watercolor on Canson paper p.s. my first melonkitten book is available on Etsy (www.etsy.com\/de\/listing\/188048\u2026 or via mail to melonkitten@hotmail.de","medium":null,"title":"blueberry Melonkitten Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual","url":"https:\/\/melonkitten.deviantart.com\/art\/blueberry-465364385\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Illustration","Conceptual"],"filename":"blueberry Melonkitten Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/melonkitten.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/97e8\/i\/2014\/184\/c\/8\/blueberry_by_melonkitten-d7p2dgh.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Yellow"],"artist":"lunadarko","description":"aqua oil on wood;

Many of those paintings include a \u201Ctwisted perspective\u201D in which the undersides of the feet are shown. In a single image, those artists of old accurately showed what the animals looked like and the tracks they would leave, producing the earliest nature guides. In a similar abstract style, this painting depicts a current North American animal, the Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus), with its feet twisted upward to show its tracks. I also included some realistic full-size tracks, which are based on my plaster casts from the actual local animals here in southern California. (see also my YouTube channel video youtu.be\/I16PPjydSOE) This work is an original acrylic painting that I designed and hand painted on a 12 inch by 24 inch ceramic tile. The design is based on my many years of studying our native animals and their tracks. Like the handprints found in European caves, I signed this artwork with my \u201Chandprint,\u201D which includes my initials RCM.","medium":null,"title":"Prehistoric Style Mule Deer painting RobertMeyer Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals RobertMeyer #cave #deer #mule #nature #painting #prehistoric #tracks","url":"https:\/\/robertmeyer.deviantart.com\/art\/Prehistoric-Style-Mule-Deer-painting-652406297\/?purchase=print&itemids=24","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Animals"],"filename":"Prehistoric Style Mule Deer painting RobertMeyer Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals RobertMeyer #cave #deer #mule #nature #painting #prehistoric #tracks_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/robertmeyer.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/3703\/th\/pre\/f\/2016\/355\/a\/5\/a59af9fe7724d22bf8e00c3a95c0d141-dasfbx5.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"borda","description":"oil on canvas 50x70cm","medium":null,"title":"In my dreams you always bring me to the Moon... borda Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal borda #adrian #bear #borda #girl #love #moon #moonrise #oil #oniric #painting #romania #surreal #teddy #teddybear #dreamworks (show more)","url":"https:\/\/borda.deviantart.com\/art\/In-my-dreams-you-always-bring-me-to-the-Moon-572136552\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Surreal"],"filename":"In my dreams you always bring me to the Moon... borda Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal borda #adrian #bear #borda #girl #love #moon #moonrise #oil #oniric #painting #romania #surreal #teddy #teddybear #dreamworks (show more)_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/borda.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/59a9\/i\/2015\/318\/4\/e\/in_my_dreams_you_always_bring_me_to_the_moon____by_borda-d9gmve0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," White"],"artist":"JeffDee","description":"This is my re-creation of the front cover artwork from the AD&D adventure module C2: The Ghost Tower of Inverness.

The James Homestead is in the Lanark area of Ontario, and was in the James family from 1883 to 1959. Although it's no longer in the family, it still holds a sentimental place in the hearts of many family members. The intent was to paint the farm as it appeared in the 1950's so, to do this, I worked with several photographs. This painting borrows most heavily from a picture that was taken in the mid-80's, which shows all of the buildings and out-buildings that make up the farm. Obviously, not all are original (like the silo), and others have changed (like the farmhouse), so I had to make changes them to make them appear as they had been thirty years earlier. What really drew me to this 1980's picture were the wagon tracks leading through the field towards the farmhouse, as well as the hint of a fence in the foreground (although I couldn't quite figure out how it was the path lead right through the fence without a gate). I asked my father about it. He remembers the path as being the one that they used to pull the wagon along to get to the back fields. He said that there might have been a wooden gate there originally, but it was also possible that the wire was simply rolled back to pass through. This is the only real artistic license I took with the painting. I decided that I wanted to put a wooden gate in the foreground to give the painting some real depth, and I found the answer I needed in an old photograph taken in 1957 that shows part of the barn, with the farmhouse and garage (in its original position) on the hill. There's a lot of tiny little details of interest in this black and white image (like the laundry stand beside the garage that my Grandmother would use, or the ladder on the side of the barn that my Grandfather would climb to get on top of a load of hay before it was hoisted up into the loft), but the one that caught my eye was the open wooden gate to the right of the barn. This was the proof that I needed that there was at least one wooden gate in use on the farm in the 50's - surely I could get away with putting another one so prominently in my painting? The young boy running up the road was a last minute addition to the painting. When I had about half of the field completed, the idea to add the figure occurred to me and, with a lot of help from my brother Brent and some old family pictures that he sent me, I was able to dress the boy exactly as my father would have been dressed in the era.

Acrylics on canvas sheet, unframed, 20\" by 16\" Psychologist Elaine Aron writes in her book The Highly Sensitive Person that about 15 to 20 percent of the population is characterized as highly sensitive (HS). She adds that about 30 percept of people are moderately sensitive, while 50 percent of people think of themselves as being sensitive while they are \"not at all sensitive.\" What being highly sensitive is NOT: 1. Emotionally immature 2. Self-centered 3. Unpredictable and unstable emotions 4. Over-dependent 5. Demanding and attention thirsty Characteristics of highly sensitive people: 1. Have great imagination 2. Have great intellectual abilities 3. Are creative 4. Have a curious mind 5. Are hard workers 6. Are good problem solvers 7. Are extremely conscious and compassionate 8. Are intuitive, caring and spiritual 9. Have a strong sense of aesthetic awareness 10. Respect nature, art and music greatly 11. Have profound and intense sensations 12. Can access important information from the unconscious mind 13. Have a depth of understanding and feelings 14. Are objective and can see the bigger picture If these individuals don't learn to handle their high sensitivity, they may suffer greatly. Some of these are a loss of balance when it comes to a self-sacrifice schema, which always leads to emotional deprivation. For instance, Jeffrey E. Young links high sensitivity, or as he calls it, the \"highly empathic temperament\" with the Self-Sacrifice Schema (Young, 2003, pp. 246-251), which in turn is almost always related to the Emotional Deprivation Schema. In his opinion, these individuals need to learn to focus on themselves instead of or before focusing on others and to learn to get their own needs met fist, needs they typically are not aware of. After that self understanding, they will have a clear picture of what they want to do with their life to make a difference. Some ways that can help HS people manage their abilities: 1. Emotionally, highly-sensitive individuals are easily overstimulated up to a point where they may experience great pain or great joy. They can have a combination of an introvert and an extrovert personality traits due to the fact that they need to be by themselves to become centered, and they also love connecting to other people and their environment. As reported before, many of these people learn to mask this gift of sensitivity, intuition and creativity because they do not know how to deal with the overstimulation. Cognitive modification can be helpful 2. Physically, highly-sensitive people need time and space to be by themselves to process the amount of input they absorb. They may have low tolerance to noise and anything too strong when it comes to sensations. They also seem to have more body awareness and can feel when their body is not comfortable in an environment. Therefore, nutritionally they have to stick to simple foods that are full of nutrients and have a healthy balance. They also have to connect to nature and do regular exercise, relaxation, meditation and any other activities that go with their nature to calm themselves down and recharge after the over stimulation. 3. Socially, sometimes HS people may feel like misfits and have to learn ways to tolerate imperfections they see in the depth of others. They need to learn to connect while having clear boundaries as to when to say no and how far to go with something and someone. In addition, HS people need to become assertive and have regular \"me\" times. When it comes to their social personality, these individuals are usually shy, but their shyness is not because they are weak but rather is based on a need to survive. Since their nature is oversensitive, biologically they are designed to be shy as a self-protection mode. However, if the shyness is too much and is affecting their need to be social and to connect, then they can modify it through behavioral and cognitive modification. 4. Additionally, they have to learn to give and receive love and they have to realize that the process has to have a balance point. They have to understand that self sacrifice that leads to emotional deprivation is not healthy. They have to allow themselves to be vulnerable, face problems rather than running away from them, relate positively to life, and learn from their experiences. Some of these individuals avoid some areas of their life and some of the challenges because of their oversensitivity not realizing that in some of these challenges lies great opportunity. 5. And last but not least, these individuals have to find a meaning in their life. All humanity desires this but for HS people, this is a need. It is their innermost desire to help others be happy, and they can use their abilities to bring their creative side out and make this world a better place for all, even if a small step. Overall, many of our writers, creators, inventors, imaginaries, discoverers, and people who have contributed greatly to this world may fall in the category of highly sensitive. We need more of these people and we need to encourage them to unleash their potential. For those people who want to become more sensitive, they have to learn ways to overcome society's encouragement to be overly analytical, materialistic and competitive and to encourage themselves and others to cherish this trait and make the best of it.

Thank you. » FACEBOOK « | » PRINTS « FAQ: Due to thousands of questions and my lack of time to answer them all here are the answers for the most frequently asked: Q:How many colors do you have and what pens are these? A: I have 8 colored Bic ballpoint pens, for this I used 6 of them plus black. They are just common everyday ballpoint pens. Buy them here: www.amazon.co.uk\/Bic-Cristal-P\u2026 you can also buy the Staedtler ball 432 or the Scent Sibles www.whsmith.co.uk\/CatalogAndSe\u2026 Q: Where do you get them? I have never seen them. A: Staples, Ebay, Amazon, and pretty much any good office supply store, just because you haven't noticed them before doesn't mean they don't exist! Q: Do you use any other medium mixed with the ballpoint pens? A: No, I just use ballpoint pens for these drawings. Everything is 100% ballpoint pen. Q: How do you mix the colors? How do you blend them? A: I don't mix them nor blend them. Ballpoint pen ink dries instantly and can not be erased. I just cross hatch the different colors in layers to create the illusion of blending and the illusion of colors I don't actually have. Q: Are you a professional Artist? A: No, I'm just a lawyer, art is just a hobby for me, although it takes from 20 to 500 hours or more to finish each drawing. I started drawing when I was 2, that's 29 years of experience. Q: What colors do you have? A: Yellow, orange, magenta, light green, light blue, blue, pink, purple. I also have a classic black and a classic blue Bic pens. Q: Do you trace the drawings, use projected images, what do you do to get the proportions? A: No. I use a grid on the reference, I then draw another pencil grid on the paper to make the drawing the exact size I want, then draw the simple outlines in pencil as accurately as possible and then erase the pencil as I color the drawing. I look and draw, fully freehand, the traditional typical old way. At this point I don't need a grid, I can draw just by looking, I just use one to save time. Q: Do you use photo manipulation, digital effects, drawing tablets or any other digital medium? A: No. I like to do my work traditionally, the hard way, the way I like and the only way I know how. Q: Some say drawing exact copies of photos is not art. A: I don't care what some people think and couldn't care any less! I love realism, I only draw for myself, as a hobby, to improve my own skills, to practice on my own, and because I love it, not to please critics. Also, there are as many concepts of what is art as there are humans on earth, so what really matters is what art is for you, in your heart, not what others think it is or what others think it should be. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Edit: Thank you very kindly ^Astralseed for the Daily Deviation!

This drawing I did some time ago for a community with an important message. Lately I've heard often those quotes like that, so I decided to twitch into a drawing instead just letters of that quote for a community. This message regards for working artists. And I'm not talking about art as general meaning and art is for money, but the service for others when someone asks us to draw what they want. I thought also to put there. That's why we, working artists, don't do any free requests as a service for others when we are asked. I still get often a requests from people, and here is an excellent quote from my friend ~WildSpiritWolf faq, which explains a lot for those who can't see\/understand the view of another person: Q: Why won't you do a picture\/tattoo\/etc. for me for free? It's silly that I have to pay to have you make something for me. A: Please try to see this from another person's point of view. I'm sorry but I do not work for free and have no plans to change that. Commissions are my full time job so if I did art for free, I would have no money. Plus I would be ridiculously busy because so many people would be lining up to get free art from me. So at that point, I would be broke and would be drowning in free art requests which would leave me very stressed and unhappy. Simply, art is our job. The feeling where we work on art is the same as we would do other job. You can share that picture and spread around. I permit people to use this on facebook, blogs, websites, communities, tumblr etc. and feature it anywhere. I made it to be shared- we are about to share that art is part of our job to everyone If you agree with this :] Feel free to share this! But please DO NOT remove my signature and link to website and do not claim that you drew it. Do not use for also for commercial goals, ask me if you plan to do! :] For the information: This is my own opinion and feeling with this, as well among the other artist. I made it for my group of artist community where I am in where they share the same feeling about it and that's it. It is NOT a law, order or even \"it has to be\". Everyone may have different opinions, and if someone things doing free requests is ok, it's totally fine! Free requests aren't bad, but for some people there is a limit reached where some artists can't do anymore due to clear reasons as being working artists. If you agree with this, that's fine, you may share and show your own feelings, if not, that's fine! Just do what you want Remember what I posted, it's also my feeling and opinion with others but not with everyone. Everyone has a right to their own feelings and that's a clean explaination why we don't do free requests. Even, personally I have not positive experience with \"free requests\" from people whom I do not know in the past. Doing personal art and projects where I put my feelings and free thoughts, I have fun and enjoyment what I love, thus doing commission work is totally different feeling- a feeling of my duty and job. Personally I still do \"free work\" which is an exception known as a gifts for my close people who I very cherish, working on art for them I think about them. It has positive feelings of the bonds and memories with them. And another, I'm active person in charity foundations\/organizations, where I volunteer doing visual graphics where I also enjoy of a help for others in my foundation. I find it's priceless feeling being part of foundation and helping whose are in a need, being among with those fantastic people and fighting with life crisis. Since there were many questions regarding art =\/= fun, I hope that will explain :] [link] Also to mention, I think the most beautiful art creations are when we do personal artwork. We put our own thoughts, own feelings, emotions and freedom- our world is put on the paper. No one should comment us what we should do when we create own and personal artwork from the heart.

The history that i share with my namesake and favourite fox of all time, the Culpeo Fox, is quite a complex one that is pretty hard to tell in just a few sentences. I could go on and on about how much this animal means to me, how it came about in my life, how and why i borrowed its name to become my professional alias, Culpeo S. Fox (the S. at first being just part of a stupid little wordplay (Raven S. Fox = ravenous fox ), but it wasn't until 2014\/2015 or so, when i would finally and officially include it to the name, with an actual meaning behind). I could talk about how Sin, one of my oldest characters evolved as it all collides in this one, giant mess of connected background story - but that would break the mould. Another story for another time perhaps. So, here is just an abridged version. The Culpeo is a (South-American) vulpine-lookalike. So much, that it is even blatantly called \"Red Fox\" in some places (though, it varies greatly in size and shape, depending on where they occur). Look at it and people will almost always initially say: Fox. You'd rarely guess that it actually is a member of the Canini tribe, which excludes the true foxes but houses wolves, jackals and coyotes (and it is neither of those either). And so am i, in a weird, twisted kinda way: A (vulpine) South-American lookalike. People guessing my heritage by mere looks would always say: Chile. Or Peru. It's true, i have a record of anecdotes\/statistics by now. I had South-American tourists\/sellers suddenly start talking Spanish to me a few times now, since they thought i was a familiar fellow. None of them would come up with Thailand. Germany not even close. Thais and Germans themselves included. The Culpeo and i, both of us are \"False Foxes\" in our own right. It's a rather derogative term at first sight and probably could also be used that way but honestly, i'm actually quite fond of it. Yes, i am a False Fox - and happily so. \/SYMBOLISM ~ Also, sorry for the recent silence. I was SUPER-busy the past few weeks. Have seen the Pet Shop Boys SUPER-Tour live in concert together with Skia (and i still feel SUPER-dizzy when thinking back to it. By God, my heart (beat). The music, the voice, the coolness, the style, the EMOTION. Skia and i are in LOVE, Jesus, i want to just TALK about it all day, hfbsfbsk. The last time i felt that way was back in 2013 when i saw Bruce Springsteen. Now, only Susumu Hirasawa and Hans Zimmer are on the list before i can die. Fanart tributes SO MUCH to come) - and went straight to Paris after that (where i saw a real life Concorde, some statues of Alexander The Great at the Louvre, almost kidnapped some bones at the museum of comparative anatomy and freshly fell in love with the Notre Dame, among other things). What a beautiful, avant-garde city.","medium":null,"title":"Culpeo Fox Culpeo-Fox Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals Culpeo-Fox #animal #culpeo #fox #gao #sak #pseudalopex #culpaeus #lycalopex #payanak #naga #tattoo #thai #thailand #yant #yord (show more)","url":"https:\/\/culpeo-fox.deviantart.com\/art\/Culpeo-Fox-691684347\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Animals"],"filename":"Culpeo Fox Culpeo-Fox Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals Culpeo-Fox #animal #culpeo #fox #gao #sak #pseudalopex #culpaeus #lycalopex #payanak #naga #tattoo #thai #thailand #yant #yord (show more)_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/culpeo-fox.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/bcb0\/f\/2017\/191\/6\/1\/culpeo_fox2_by_culpeo_fox-dbft723.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," White"],"artist":"Hellanim","description":"Norse mythology...

Was a lot of fun even though cat kept attacking the camera hahahfdg. I have to confess though, I've never had as much trouble with colouring a picture. Or it wasn't really difficult, but I just couldn't decide the colours and tried so many things and either liked all of them or disliked them. Originally it was all orange, then I added some blue but it ended up looking like purple again and then I wanted to make it greenish\/orange with cold shadows and warm light source and to make the orange monarch butterflies really pop. I always seem to go for purple so was trying to break away from that and using it too much\/relying on it. Even one of my teachers say I use a lot of purple and I didn't even notice it fully until she said it : D If there's any purple in this piece it's not intentional, I didn't use the colour but some layers with different effects might have created that. Oh well I tried! XD trying to stay away from purple for a while anyway. Also tried to make it look like it could be coloured in watercolour etc. This is kind of a remake of a really old picture of mine I did when I was 15, some might remember it if you watched my previous account. been 7 years oh my.... The title comes from the nickname of the monarch butterfly, thought it was fitting for this piece Drawn in pencil, coloured in Photoshop. Putting this in the Traditional artwork category as most of the time I spent on this was traditional media (maybe about 6 hours) and the digital colouring took a lot less time than that. I remember reading that as a rule of thumb the part that took longer should be the category, but it's difficult when you combine both.","medium":null,"title":"Wanderer Lhuin Watch Traditional Art Drawings Animals Lhuin","url":"https:\/\/lhuin.deviantart.com\/art\/Wanderer-399235928\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Animals"],"filename":"Wanderer Lhuin Watch Traditional Art Drawings Animals Lhuin_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/lhuin.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/973e\/f\/2015\/201\/e\/a\/wanderer_by_lhuin-d6lp0ew.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Culpeo-Fox","description":"A personality who revealed herself in a most recent dream of mine. I dreamed of a band of street cats, being a stranger among them (although i don't know whether i was a cat as well or something else). I remember that i needed some help or answers or whatever it was - and these cats told me: \"Go to Bluebottle, she might help.\" And then, they pushed me to an outsider cat who just looked worn out. Absolutely pitch-black, ruffled fur and so scrawny that her anatomy looked unatural (like a greyhound or something). What i remember best was her fur which got unnaturally iridescent in sunlight - like....well. A blue bottle fly. It looked unreal, and it was the only thing that gave her some kind of illusionary beauty. \"Are you Bluebottle?\" i asked and everything i got back was a terrible hissing sound, followed by words like these: \"Riffraff, that is how they keep calling me! They shall all suffer in pain. Bambastarde, that is my real name! Piss off, you awkwardness!\" I can't get this cat out of my head now. You know, one of those dreams with a special vividness. And i don't know who she really is.

She hears her own shallow sips of air as starlight shines on the writhing fog, as a gust of cold wind takes on its own color and burnishes the contorting and changing figure, as moonlight warms the arms and hands suddenly outstretched, and gleams on the face turned up to the night sky \u0096 Siehst du den Erlkönig nicht? Den Erlenkönig mit Kron und Schweif? - and burns into her mind the image of someone she knows, from long ago, reaching up and pulling part of the sky, black strewn with stars, down and around his shoulders - Do you not see the Elf King? The Elven King with crown and cloak? Sarah looks, openmouthed despite herself, as the cloak tumbles to the ground in a sweep of soft darkness, and as stars fall, gently, to settle in windswept hair and make a crown. Then she feels the bottom drop out of her stomach as the figure turns to look at her, and walks smoothly towards her, flowing over the bumpy roots and through sharp branches. Those same branches twist back from touching it - their wild jerks and snaps should be audible, but there is only silence. A whisper comes to her from her memory. She mutters the phrase to herself, under her breath: \u0093It\u0092s a wisp of fog \u0085\u0094 (es ist ein Nebelstreif) \u0093It\u0092s a wisp of fog \u0085\u0094 The being stops before her, and smiles. \u0093Really, Sarah.

From Chapter 5 of Subtilior's Erlkönig fanfic. Which rocketh beyond anything, except possibly what she's writing now. She does the most amazing Evil!Jareth.

Many of those paintings include a \u201Ctwisted perspective\u201D in which the undersides of the feet are shown. In a single image, those artists of old accurately showed what the animals looked like and the tracks they would leave, producing the earliest nature guides. In a similar abstract style, this painting depicts a current North American animal, the Mountain Lion (Puma concolor), with its feet twisted upward to show its tracks. I also included some realistic full-size tracks, which are based on my plaster casts from the actual local animals here in southern California. (see also my YouTube channel video youtu.be\/I16PPjydSOE) This work is an original acrylic painting that I designed and hand painted on a 12 inch by 24 inch ceramic tile. The design is based on my many years of studying our native animals and their tracks.

The next two are harder to understand because we do not come into direct contact with them in our daily life. The string of beads represents the Strong Force, which is the force that is responsible for binding together Atoms and the even smaller elements that Atoms are made of.

Thanks ~no-need-for-a-name!! ~~~~~~~~~~ I am finally able to post this commission. A drawing I made for my oldest brother: .: :. Last year he graduated at uni and yesterday was his 26th birthday. As a gift I drew a guitar. The same as he has, only this one is right handed and he's a lefty. (; A very gifted musician he is ever since age of 10. I never really told him but... I'm so proud of him. Glad to have an awesome bro like you. This beauty is called an Les Paul guitar and is based upon a great picture which can be found here ---> Guitar by ~no-need-for-a-name. ---------------------------------------------- ...Honestly, this drawing is more personal than you might think in the first place. No-one actually knows that my heart truly lies at music. Drawing has always been the second... Before I went ambitious in what I do these days, I aspired to become something totally different: an all-round musician. From age 6 'till 16 I studied the arts of music, from classical guitar to drums. In no time I picked up an instrument and played along with every song I heard. But as my health became weak and the energy to play music slipped away, I had no other option but to let go of my dream to become a great musician in 2004 -no matter how hard it was for me- and started to focus on something else: visual arts. Also known as: drawing. Luckily I found the energy to play music again. Since a few weeks I'm playing the bassguitar and things are going as good (or even better) as they were before. I'm glad! ---------------------------------------------- About the drawing The bodystructure of this guitar has been the most difficult thing I've ever drawn so far. I wasn't used in drawing materials like that. It was a great practice. Something I don't wish to do again lol. Stuff I used: 4H, 2H, H, HB, B and 2B o.5mm mechanical pencils for basically everything several tissues for blending kneaded and pencil erasers reference image Hahnemühle sketchbook paper, the best I've used so far!

They have been reported as far north as Texas. North of Mexico, they are found regularly only in the extreme southern part of Texas, although there are rare sightings in southern Arizona. The ocelot's genus Leopardus consists of nine species similar to the ocelot, such as Geoffroy's cat and the Margay cat, which are also endemic to South and Central America. All of the cats in Leopardus are spotted, lithe, and small, with the ocelot being the biggest. Commission for Mr. Howard Cairns Written authorization was given to me to use this photo as reference for derivative work. Took aprox. 80 hours to finish over a period of 5 weeks.

Well, this one is on Schoellerhammer, too, but on 4G instead of 4R paper, and 4G is normally for airbrush and not for pencil drawings. And is was hell hard to draw on this paper, so I decided not to finish it anymore... but after looking at it again, I just had to.

This spotted cat most closely resembles the leopard physically, although it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer to those of the tiger.

From the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that made up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness; the shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where four roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public wells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs sprouting on their sides.\" I made this illustration the International Contest: \"Arrival and Departures\" [link]","medium":null,"title":"The Lost Temple Galhad Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Storybook","url":"https:\/\/galhad.deviantart.com\/art\/The-Lost-Temple-78986216\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Illustration","Storybook"],"filename":"The Lost Temple Galhad Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Storybook_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/galhad.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/b14f\/th\/pre\/f\/2008\/063\/2\/0\/the_lost_temple_by_galhad.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Green"],"artist":"Malahicha","description":"oil on canvas","medium":null,"title":"blue 07 12 Malahicha Watch Traditional Art Paintings Other Malahicha","url":"https:\/\/malahicha.deviantart.com\/art\/blue-07-12-316672289\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Other"],"filename":"blue 07 12 Malahicha Watch Traditional Art Paintings Other Malahicha_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/malahicha.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/aa9a\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/206\/7\/6\/blue_07_12_by_malahicha-d58jdwh.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Sceith-A","description":"Norse mythology illustration for MarinArk","medium":null,"title":"Sleipnir Sceith-A Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual Sceith-A","url":"https:\/\/sceith-a.deviantart.com\/art\/Sleipnir-427119300\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Illustration","Conceptual"],"filename":"Sleipnir Sceith-A Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual Sceith-A_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/sceith-a.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/f240\/th\/pre\/i\/2014\/020\/7\/8\/sleipnir_by_sceithailm-d72and0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"CristianoTeofili","description":"mixed media on paper, 17x24 cm","medium":null,"title":"Into You CristianoTeofili Watch Traditional Art Drawings Abstract CristianoTeofili #into #you","url":"https:\/\/cristianoteofili.deviantart.com\/art\/Into-You-724530826\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Abstract"],"filename":"Into You CristianoTeofili Watch Traditional Art Drawings Abstract CristianoTeofili #into #you_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/cristianoteofili.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/7372\/i\/2018\/008\/4\/f\/into_you_by_cristianoteofili-dbzd7ka.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Culpeo-Fox","description":"Random Culpeo Fox and Random Red Fox.

Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord Envy them that? Can it be sin to know, Can it be death?

He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate of learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human ears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of modesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of civilization. Give me the storm and tempest of thought and action, rather than the dead calm of ignorance and faith! Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!\" - Robert Green Ingersoll from The Gods I was sure to try and stay close to the Greek Orthodox iconography style and use of symbolism.

THE STORY OF THE PAINTING ------------------------------------------- Kilclooney Dolmen is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and impressive ancient monuments in the entire country. The Stone Age inhabitants of Ireland were great builders as well as great warriors, male and female. Over a thousand of their monuments survive to this day despite the machinations of the venal political elite who rule us now. Kilclooney Dolmen is particularly graceful and artistic, poised like a great bird of prey about to soar into the sky. The Dolmen, or Cromleac, also known as a portal tomb, usually is covered with earth and smaller stones to form a barrow, and in this case the covering has weathered away leaving the magnificent stone skeleton of the burial chamber intact. This was originally one of a series commissioned for a calendar for the Bank of Ireland titled \u0091The Heritage of Ireland\u0092 and it was my first real venture into landscape painting using the more stylized forms I had developed for my Celtic work. I have since extended this series for my own satisfaction and like all series dealing with ancient heritage of Ireland the possibilities are endless.","medium":null,"title":"The Kilclooney Dolmen.

Loosing a threadbare sigh, he turned the scrap over in his hands, waiting for it to reveal the answer his heart sought. But it breathed no words of comfort, no wise council, merely made his heart beat with that same curious pattern it did whenever she was in his thoughts. Silently, he stood, lifting his sword and oiled cloak as he did. Sliding the embroidered jacket over his shirt, he left the barracks, evading the sentries easily. *** No sound betrayed his soft footfalls as he crossed weathered, cracked tiles, the white walls of the derelict church faded to murky yellow in the sun's rising light. Yet his heart pounded a deafening rhythym as he neared where he knew she would be waiting, and when the wisp of white lace ruffled over the stonework as he stepped into the entrance, it exploded in chorus within his head. She was perfect. Willow-soft, bending with the breeze, her long dark locks blown to a flag he would follow to the bloodiest battle, liquid brown eyes bore into his with a fervor he would die to protect. Clad in pure white and gold, she was his goddess made real. When she threw herself around his neck and breathed tearfully, he would have torn down the halls of heaven to stop her coming to harm. Which was why he had to leave. She sensed the tension in him as he stepped back from the embrace. \"Please Raven, don't go. I can stop it, my father...\" His hand brushed over her lips, and they fell quiet, her eyes falling to the floor. \"I must.\" The tears that fell from her cheeks could have ground his soul to dust and blown it to the wind, crumbling his body and all that stood around him. The pain of her breaking heart could have broken his back, had he not known she were to be safer if he left. \"But... our love. You would throw it all away, to run? At least let me run with you, Raven! We could hide from the world, and I could cast my chains aside! How I long for the simple life, with you, my love!\" He stood motionless in the face of her plea. \"I must leave. Our love is the reason, chére. You are the Black Rose, the hope of the nation. You were never meant to love the likes of me, and I must leave, if this kingdom is not to fall. You must see to it it does not, for if it should fall, we shall never have one another.\" She looked up, her eyes like gateways to heaven, glistening wet. He took her delicate body to his own, kissed her soft hair as she buried her face in the feathers that had given him his name. \"For you,\" she whispered, \"I would let the kingdom fall to ruin.\" \"That, chére, is why I must leave.\" __________________________________ Coloured pencil on beige card, the character designs very much influenced by Phantom of The Opera.

This has been huge motivation to finish this one up! Besides being busy with average day to day things I just have not liked how my drive to finish this 7 deadly sin project has been going\u0085 but its going to be completed! I was always just worried id get slack on the project and the next few sins left to go would become slack and rushed\u0085 This is now finished and I have to say it looks great and I no longer have that fear of the next 3 sins being a rushed and slack effort Yes compared to my 7 deadly sin greed image all the others look simpler but believe me they are no more rushed than any of my best works! A lot of people told me \u0096the caterpillar for sloth would be perfect!- and yes I do also agree but I\u0092m saving him for another sin\u0085 I chose to do the Cheshire cat because he does also fit\u0092s into sloth, I didn\u0092t draw him in a very sloth like pose mainly because I think along with being a sloth he is still sneaky and wicked \u0085 a bit mad and naughty. He does stir Alice up quiet a bit in wonderland. I wanted to express his true colours in this image along with displaying him over the title \u0096sloth- I\u0092m happy with everything that has turned out in this including the little quirky mome wraths *if you remember them* the Cheshire cat is \u0096based- on my design I did for my tattoo of the Cheshire cat \u0085tho I changed it quiet a lot because id rather not have the image I have tattooed up on here for the fact that nobody can steal what they cant see or get a hold of. But my favourite bits of this are the backgrounds and such and not really the Cheshire cat\u0085 Well I hope you enjoy, full view And as all of my art its drawn on A3 sized paper I used faber castel watercolour pencils *no added water* Ink and pens. ~dontkillthellama, has wrote another for this image [link] please do read her quirky writings do add to the image.

The Eurasian Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) is a species of eagle owl resident in much of Eurasia.

In India, it is often called the Indian Great Horned Owl, though this may cause confusion with the similarly named American bird. It is one of the largest species of owls.

This is the 7 deadly sin greed I decided to do it green and I\u0092m not really sure why I know that ill also do envy green and maybe lust red as I have done pride\u0085 but we shall see. I chose to use the mad hatter and the hare with their tea party for greed because in cartoon movie of Alice in wonderland the mad hatter and the hare are quiet greedy when Alice comes to join them at their over large tea party\u0085 *no room* they shout out at her even though they have too much tea to spare and chairs for that matter. FULLVIEW please I love the colours the greens and purples with a bit of blue and pink it\u0092s all very yummy. I am just a little disappointed with how it turned out, it\u0092s a little hard to see what is going on in this image ..which is a bit of a shame.

I\u0092m planning to make them all related to the fairly tail Alice in wonderland. For pride I chose the queen of hearts! She is bold and a leader, with a mirror in her hand she admires her power and strength, cutting the heads off others who don\u0092t follow her rules always here is my way here as she bellows. Her hair is shaped like a love heart along with almost everything else even her body shape In that tight dress with the extreme low cut is just how I pictured her in my mind. I also gave her some spider characteristics\u0085.and I\u0092m not entirely sure why.. I just feel she is like an insect in many ways, no care for other creatures as being an insect is a pretty cruel and nasty world at times *watch docos* she is like a female spider-larger than the males and in higher power- most female spiders kill and eat the male gender sometimes after breeding or just for fun. I would appreciate you take a full view look at this one because from afar its not nearly as good as close up. I was a bit lazy with this one, the image almost looks like a card with the hearts on bottom and top\u0085though I didn\u0092t make an effort to make anything symmetrical ..although I feel it adds to the charm of what this is in a way. the font used abover is also my own hand writing and im not sure if i like it.

The 7 deadly sin project was something I didn\u0092t expect to become quiet so popular *as it did* and I have received notes after notes of people requesting I finish the project and asking \u0096where is the 7th sin?- Well here she is finally\u0085 I hope it does not look too rushed *as it was not, but I feel it has very little detail in it as some of the other additions to the project, but let me tell you, THIS was NOT a half hearted job!* so hopefully you guys like it, for this is probably the first image I have ever drawn due to so much request for it to be completed by the public. This sin is ENVY, I had a hard time trying to decide what characters to use for this last deadly sin. The project as many know was based around the tradish Alice in wonderland Disney movie. But it is really based on all the Alice in wonderland stories\u0085 But mixing it up and making it abit my own. I chose to use ALICE in the last sin because she was the main character and although I used her in a few of the other sins, she never really had the spot light. So I thought it would be silly not having her own part when wonderland is ALL about Alice Here I presented Alice as a pretty wreckless teen maybe? Split personality\u0085 The Alice on the right is the Alice venturing down to wonderland The other is straight Alice in what would be considered \u0091real time Alice\u0092. Alice envies herself? Envies the Alice that is in wonderland. I know that my version is a little trippy and hard to make sense of, but I got a lot of inspiration from the American mcgee alice, girl interrupted. And of course\u0085 the ORIGONAL story and the person who actually wrote it She is surrounded by flowers *remember the flowers in the movie?* I was going to present this with wonderland Alice crying out to real time sleeping Alice outside the door, and I do know it\u0092s not really envy more maybe\u0085 panic and trauma \u0085 so I tweaked my ideas a little. Anyway I hope this satisfies. If I could I probably would redo this project and do it all differently\u0085 but \u0096shrugs- And now, the 7 deadly sins are complete. I had a lot of fun working thought and completing it. Originals all drawn on A3 paper.

Bizarrely, that word .. Luxuriance... had been running in my head for days like an intriguing leitmotiv, and painting it out seemed the most natural and only way to shut the voice. Here is a painting I finished in january after 3 months of daily efforts. I've forced myself to paint everyday, despite the usual overwork at 2Roqs. For once this painting isn't about a deep worry I may have had, it is more simple in the meaning. Instead, I've explored domains quite new to me: for instance, I've plunged almost the whole painting into penumbra to allow a brighter light to fall down on the hand. I worked out the movement and the body language. The weird cropping of the girl should produce a disequilibrium that contradicts her course. On her face, I tried to display an expression of joyful surprise mixed with a bit of worry. Close-ups can be seen at zancan.fr.

Does anyone have good tips on how to mix gouache? To me it takes forever to hit the right colors because I'm trying to keep the jars the paint from clean from the brushes in my current use. So far the best solution I have is to use a regular knife to carve out pure color bits to mix on the palette because it's easier to clean with a napkin than a brush is. Gouache has a tricky way of blending only when the color activates after a little rubbing. I painted the clouds in this one 4 times over to get enough color to build up on the background layers. I was travelling around Finland during xmas and at first I thought carrying around 4 kilos of paint on top of the presents I had for family was a bit excessive. But then when it got a bit too much I huddled together with my black sketchbook and enormous amounts of wine and painted this. It was the exact escape I needed.

I'm digging into my stacks of old paper. What to say about this.... It's another member of my disappearing dragon series. The paper was made years ago with textile ink, leaves (to make the pattern) and salt. My visual idea was to have a creature (creatures) breaking a liquid surface, and to use an opaque paint to signify form above the water, and move to a transparent medium when addressing objects beneath the water. The result was very successful (and I should like to try it again) but the paper fought me all the way. Salt has a tendency to get into the fibers and disrupt paint, especially watery paint. The salt was accidental. The paper had absorbed it from some other paper sitting in the pile. But well, these things happen, and it turned out well regardless. I wish I could work a bit more on it, but the convention looms, and I need to get onto other things. I'll price it high, and if I bring it home, I'll work on it some more.

I found it today and decide to share it with you all. This is one of the longest projects which I am working on. The reason I said it's longest because I have the concept for few years but it always drops. It drops not because I stop draw but everytime I draw half of piece, I have new concept of that animal so I start again (the circle repeats at least 4 times ). But anyway, this is one of the piece done. I am sorry I can't make them finish to make new calendar as I promised with someone 3 years ago (I know, I am such a super slow worker ;A; ). ----------------------------------------------------- More and more, not only polar bears are dying day by day because of the Global Warming & other reasons.

Finally I started watching the tv series \"Supernatural\" (I finished season 2) and it's great so far. I really like the character \"Dean\" (played by Jensen Ackles), because he's funny, so I decided to draw him. But it's a bit strange for me, because a few days ago I noticed that I had a poster of him on my wall ~13 years ago (I totally forgot that he was in \"Dark Angel\", too)... At first I thought it would be more difficult to draw the water, but in the end it was fun. The most difficult part was the likeness and the \"paper\" (I'm still saving my last sheets and looking for a replacement for my favourite drawing paper, but maybe I should've used the good paper for this drawing instead of the grainier no name paper).

At the End of World, there is an endless conflict of Lightbringers and Darknesbringers- however, that keeps the world in right balance of Dark and Light. A Light cannot shine without Darkness. Tupilak, the black pitch, who is running around the world by summoning Darknessbringers- monstruos alcoholic-smoke shaped massive cloudy mass- from this materia monsters are shaped out begin based on real life creatures. When the world is plunged into darkness, the Lightbringers are coming and bringing a divine light to clean darkness away which Tupilak left. Both beasts are chasing each endlessly running around the world. Tupilak's massive dark cloudy mass has many thousands (pierwiastek), atoms and reactions- it's said it has spacial materia and incredibly strong reactions and it may explode on massive scale. Sciencists are really crazy on it.... Wanted to paint something personal and experiment a bit with more watercolors. That was so fun but really hard to draw- and I really like how it came. In couple past days I did so many crazy chemistry experiments and that painted paper I liked for the most. I found.. that expensive and awesum quality watercolor papers with neat texture really SUCKS because alcohol reactions are NOT working! The best are.. simply printer papers and hardstock smooth papers which I got- are amazing for reactions. For example, there is no green here. I mixed black with olive green, so I had greyish black. Painted base and did some weird reactions with water and ethanol so it *sepreated* that mixture into two seperate colours- black and green! Funny effect. Ah and this picture is an opposite to Lightbringers. That fragment and concepts will be used in our story.","medium":null,"title":"Darkness Bringers Exileden Watch Traditional Art Drawings Fantasy Exileden","url":"https:\/\/exileden.deviantart.com\/art\/Darkness-Bringers-166355694\/?purchase=print&itemids=85","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Fantasy"],"filename":"Darkness Bringers Exileden Watch Traditional Art Drawings Fantasy Exileden_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/exileden.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/9a10\/i\/2010\/154\/b\/8\/darkness_bringers_by_pearleden.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"LinzArcher","description":"A moment of peace shared between a knight and his lady.

In later Greek myth She is depicted as a mortal princess, but it's pretty clear Her origins are divine. In the Greek legend She was the daughter of King Minos of Crete; Her half-brother was the monstrous half-man, half-bull Minotaur imprisoned within the labyrinth. When Theseus came, as part of the tribute of youths and maidens fed to the monster, She fell in love with him and helped him to defeat the Minotaur, in part by giving him a ball of string to unwind and then rewind so he could find his way back. Theseus, being a git, abandoned Her the first chance he got; but here Her divine origins shine through a bit, as the God Dionysos then found Her and fell in love with Her, and They were married. She was, most likely, already His wife. As a Goddess then Ariadne has Underworld and even shamanic attributes, as the labyrinth represents the journey into the dark and the subsequent return to the light. She is also associated with stars; the constellation of the Corona Borealis is said to have been Her marriage crown. (This constellation is also associated with the Welsh Goddess Arianrhod.) The Minotaur was also sometimes known by the name Asterios, meaning Star. I have shown Her here untangling the ball of thread with which the labyrinth is navigated.","medium":null,"title":"Ariadne ThaliaTook Watch Traditional Art Paintings Other ThaliaTook","url":"https:\/\/thaliatook.deviantart.com\/art\/Ariadne-323832813\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Other"],"filename":"Ariadne ThaliaTook Watch Traditional Art Paintings Other ThaliaTook_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$29.99","artistURL":"https:\/\/thaliatook.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/b081\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/240\/0\/a\/ariadne_by_thaliatook-d5csuzx.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Black"],"artist":"IrenaDem","description":"Oil on canvas 70x30 cm. 2013 Stocks used: eu.fotolia.com\/id\/26450442 by yofx www.flickr.com\/photos\/21644167\u2026 by Bahman Farzad Thanks a lot!","medium":null,"title":"Lotus tiger IrenaDem Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals IrenaDem","url":"https:\/\/irenadem.deviantart.com\/art\/Lotus-tiger-551839995\/?purchase=print&itemids=189","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Animals"],"filename":"Lotus tiger IrenaDem Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals IrenaDem_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$68.95","artistURL":"https:\/\/irenadem.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/b05f\/i\/2015\/219\/6\/0\/lotus_tiger_by_irenadem-d94jugr.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"SybileArt","description":"My last painting which could be a beautiful valetnin card no?

I am very excited but I\u0092m sure not as excited as Carie Wilson of South Africa, this young 15-16 year old girl is having a ball taking credit for my 7 deadly sins with Alice in wonderland inspirations at her school and in art class, amongst other creations of mine I\u0092m sure\u0085 I\u0092m sure she will be delighted to see the 6th edition to my almost finished 7 deadly sin project \u0096smiles- I\u0092m just glad I can work my butt of for pathetic little children like you to come by and steal my work. I am aware your probably not the only one but lets take this message as something to send to any of you who steal work that is not your own\u0085 *you can do what you want and run this roller coaster ride as fun as it is living a lie and pretending to be something your not, the truth will soon come out and if not you will always know what you did is wrong and how many people you lied to*. I hope stealing others work fulfils your little bellies for how ever long before it rots away, your head will never get rid of the truth. Better hope no one finds out about your icky little lies \u0085how embarrassing will that be! -smiles- anyway I chose to use the caterpillar as wrath because he had a very short temper in Alice in wonderland \u0085 he was very sloth- full too but lost his temper at Alice and blew a lot of smoke in her face \u0096robably got her a bit high\u0085 Of corse we all know that the caterpillar in Alice in wonderland is in fact blue but I chose to do each sin in colour tones to create interesting and different looking work\u0085 *if you didn\u0092t know* colour toning for each sin also gives me the chance to express each sin with a perfect matching colour along with the matching character of Alice in wonderland for each sin. I used yellows, oranges and pinkie red colours for something a little different with this one, I would have steered away from using more red *because I have so in two sins already* but the stoned caterpillar does blow red smoke at Alice when he got mad *in the Alice in wonderland Disney movie* I had to use red ^_^ I am pretty surprised that I feel I made this image look quiet nice considering how I\u0092m starting to get real sick and tired of this project and I do not like oranges and yellows super doper much\u0085I do hate to feel like I\u0092m ever rushing a piece just for the sake of getting it done! Rushing work always shows as doe\u0092s lack of passion -Shrugs- ill let you guys decide\u0085 PS. I had quiet defined stripes of red in the mushroom the caterpillar is sitting on\u0085and his smoke was much more detailed, filled with skull faces and swirls that don\u0092t show up so good through the scanner\u0085 Trouble with reds again\u0085 Utensils used, Faber castel watercolour pencils \u0096no added water Black Ink. poem by dontkillthellama, [link] -view my other complete sins below, one more to go!!

The show is a called \"The Road to Shermer\" a tribute show to the movies of John Hughes. You know, classic teen movies from the '80s. I chose Ferris Bueller's Day Off as it's the John Hughes film that had greatest impact on me back in the day. ***There are plot spoilers that follow if you somehow haven't seen this movie, you've been warned.*** After re-watching the film and contemplating a bit, the thought occurred to me that it is not really about Ferris Bueller. It's about Cameron Frye, Ferris's uptight best friend with a miserable home life and a lot of fears. Through the course of the film, Ferris doesn't change or grow, nor do any characters except for Cameron (and, to a lesser degree, Ferris's sister). Ferris acts as the catalyst by which Cameron is forced to confront those fears and (at least in his mind) overcomes them. The pivotal point of the film is the scene where Cameron throws himself into the pool. This is the only time in the story where Ferris seems to express real concern and emotion for anything. It's as if in this world, everything is a joke or a game, except this moment when Cameron's life is truly in question. Cameron is symbolically 'reborn' as he emerges from the pool to a new awareness that will allow him to deal with his father's anger in regards to his prized car. Cameron is the character in the movie I think most people can identify with and his 'redemption' seems the most compelling arch of the story. Anyway, here's what came of it.

The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin. The genetics of red hair, discovered in 1997, appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome 16. Red hair is associated with fair skin color because of low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair. This lower melanin-concentration confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer. The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His, and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of Vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair was not the result of positive selection and instead proposed that it occurs because of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun would be harmful to untanned skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads come about through genetic drift. Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans.

But it's the dead of winter, so it's impossible. The nightingale, who wants him to be happy and in love, decides to help him find a rose. However, she learns that the only way to make one grow is to pierce her heart on the rose bush's thorn, to make a red rose bloom out of love and blood. She dies, and the young man plucks the rose to give to his lady love. She spurns the gift, which took such a tremendous sacrifice, because it doesn't match her dress. Yeah.

Everyone would have two children at once *ouch* one boy and one girl\u0085or two same sex if that\u0092s the way they swing ..all born with one thing certain, that they where going to spend the rest of their lives together as partners. If the world was like this no one would ever miss out on feeling love like the millions of people who do today, everyone would get that special feeling and that chance to feel a bond and closeness to someone so deeply as you do when you find yourself in love. No body would be lonely ever again,\u0085imagine how happy and content the world would be if everyone was just with someone *born with a partner* Someone to talk to and share things with\u0085 Of corse this would not be the end of all our world problems\u0085but imagine if things where this way\u0085 we wouldn\u0092t know any different.

Húrin was by three years the elder, but he was shorter in stature than other men of his kin; in this he took after his mother's people, but in all else he was like Hador his grandfather, fair of face and golden-haired, strong in body and fiery of mood. But the fire in him burned steadily, and he had great endurance of will. Of all Men of the North he knew most of the counsels of the Noldor.\u0094 -- J. R. R. Tolkien: Unfinished Tales, Narn i Hîn Húrin, The Childhood of Túrin This was a pencil drawing that I started doodling in a meeting a couple of weeks ago with no idea what it would turn into.. I just started to draw a face study, decided to make it male, then a warrior.. and this happened. I didn\u0092t plan it to be a portrait initially, but after detailing the face I thought he fit my image of young Húrin, so I finished the drawing with this thought in mind. Húrin was the greatest warrior among mortal Men, his strength in arms matched only by his unbreakable will that earned him the epessë Thalion, Steadfast. Cursed by Morgoth, his fate, and that of his family, became the most tragic tale among the Edain in the Elder Days. He is shown here a couple of years after his return from Gondolin, before he had married Morwen or taken up the lordship of Dor-lómin and the House of Hador at the death of his father. It could be around FA 460, which would make him some twenty years old \u0096 not yet come to full manhood, but already a fighter hardened by many battles. He leans on his trusty axe and wears a fine coat of dwarf-mail.

I'm sorry for giving a false impression by the insufficient explanation moreover. This work is not a picture along the original of Lewis Carrol though the title is \"Alice\". There is often using Alice's motif for an original work in Japan. Alice's world is translated as a meaning of \"It is lovely\", \"Mystery\", \"Girl's world\", and \"Fantasy\" often. We obtain the idea from Alice's world, conceive freely while using those meanings, and express the work. One of the themes of my picture is \"The adult is a mature child. \" though it is not only this picture. The figure subject that I draw contains all the following meanings. --- adult,Chilrd,woman,man,me,you --- In a word, human being. Because this picture is one of the pictures drawn after that manner, the drawn person is not girl. The undergarment was not drawn because it is an expression of not the expression of a sexual thing but a mature child. Moreover, it is neither a girl it is nor a boy. Either element that was able to be specified was lost because it drew as an asexuality. For instance, skirt. Therefore, I think that I should not restrict this picture as \"Sexual picture\". And, the child and the adult come to the gallery and this picture can be seen actually. It is possible to buy it. It is a strange thing that the thing that can be freely seen by the real world is restricted in the world of the net. The expression should be free. If you read this, and understanding of this picture deepens, I am glad.

Ah.. not as successful as the others, but I don't mind.

I might have done that. I don't know. I made a few bad decisions, but hopefully I've learned from them. The markings look eerily like Link's wolf form from the latest Zelda game. At least, I think so. I've never played it, but that's what they remind me of : \/ Edit: OK, my sweets, I went back and fiddled with the picture and fixed some of the problems that I and other people agreed upon.

Erpeton tentaculum. Another example of the many rather freakish snakes that Thailand houses is the aptly named Tentacled Snake, with its give-away feature of a twin pair of \"tentacles\" attached to its snout. For the longest of time, no one could say for sure what these tentacles were for, but latest studies may suggest them to be highly mechanosensory detectors for sensing prey in murky water. Another fascinating feature is the way it hunts its main prey: Triggering the Mauthner Neuron of fish which reacts to pressure waves (which, in fish, causes a reflex to quickly move away), the snake basically fools its prey, leading it right into its mouth. Being rear-fangend, it possesses a mild venom that humans don't have to fear - the same can't be said for fish, though. See it's sneaky hunting strategy in action here: www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hP7b8q\u2026 Personal anecdote: Years back at a local snake farm in Thailand, the snake keepers were so impressed by my enthusiasm and absolute lack of fear regarding snakes (i was a little kid back then and most kids would do after their parents and naturally go all \"eewww!\" when exposed to these things) that one of them would lead me to a water jar, grab a pair of these Tentacled Snakes and put them right into my hand. I was so in love that i'd keep them for God knows how long. The snake keeper wanted to give them to me as a present, \"take them!\" And i so would have done that - if it wasn't for my mother.

In the first place I met this painting in a book, thus it was fair to place a book in the painting. It owes its title to a protagonist of this novel, though the latter is only an alibi. For the first time there is no character in it. However, the painting is far from being anonymous. In front of the blank canvas, it's difficult to know were exactly we're aiming at. We need to write the pages, we have to work our way. One can learn a lot about oneself by painting a forest. So this is a canvas that I've start in March and finished in December ( with a number of gaps in between, unfortunately ). After drifting toward warmer tones, urban material and a more contemporary feel in my works, at one point I felt this retrograde impulse to immerse into the lush again, and to make that dive alone. It was shortly after a two-months period when I invested my time in the frantic, yet unproductive job of organizing an exhibition in a gallery near home. Quite naturally this painting shows a path which is more driven toward the inside. I was expecting it to look peaceful and bright, but it turned out rather dark ( and obsessive, and stiff with some twists, but that's how far self-analysis will go ; ) ). Note that no reference was used here _ this forest is purely fantasized. You can watch some close ups on the canvas >here<. I will also try to make a video montage of the painting at its various stages, since I have been taking photographs of it all the way through!

This is my first drawing of a horse head with Ballpoint Pen. Commissioned for a book cover. The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. Took aprox. 60 hours to finish over a period of 60 days. Lost about 30% quality during scanning. The size is 90% of a standard A4 sheet.

Trent Reznor wrote it, first appearing on the concept album by Nine Inch Nails called \"The Downward Spiral\". Now, i'm also not one of those NIN-fanatics who curse the Cash version. I like both versions, actually. And only a fool will try to compare them both, because you simply can't. The version of Cash transfers the nostalgic pain of an old man looking back to a long life full of experiences one can only imagine, putting this kind of wise farewell to the words. In contrast, Reznors version describes the hopelessness and agony of a young but already destroyed soul whose way in life went to a wrong direction, depicting the deepest that you can fall into while suffering from a fatal depression. It is the end of a downward spiral. No offence. But i'm tired of people who always seem to feel urged to compare these two.","medium":null,"title":"Hurt Culpeo-Fox Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual Culpeo-Fox","url":"https:\/\/culpeo-fox.deviantart.com\/art\/Hurt-210179865\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Illustration","Conceptual"],"filename":"Hurt Culpeo-Fox Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual Culpeo-Fox_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/culpeo-fox.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/2a3f\/i\/2011\/144\/7\/4\/hurt_by_culpeo_fox-d3h4vtl.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Novawuff","description":"Annie (5yo daughter) named this for me.

(The poem appeared on www.poemhunter.com\/peter-s-qui\u2026 -------------------- Martin Luther King \"dream\" lives on, 40 years after death By AFP WASHINGTON -- On April 4 America marks the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, just as the first black candidate with a viable shot at the White House reinvigorates the late reverend's civil rights \"dream.\" In 1968 the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr was killed by a single bullet to the head while on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in downtown Memphis, in the southern state of Tennessee. The Nobel peace prize winner was just 39 years old. Had he lived he would have turned 79 in January. The mystery surrounding his assassination has swirled for years, with escaped convict James Earl Ray convicted of the murder and sentenced to 99 years in prison. Ray confessed to pulling the trigger, then quickly proclaimed his innocence. Debate over the official version of events, in which authorities determined that Ray had acted alone, remained sharp. Conspiracy theories abound, with many refusing to believe how or why this unknown convict could have escaped from a Missouri state penitentiary, planned the assassination, and thwarted King's security detail all on his own. In death King became a martyr in the civil rights struggle, but in life he was a charismatic hero battling for racial equality, from the 1956 bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama and non-violent protest marches through to his famous \"I have a dream\" speech in Washington in 1963. \"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,'\" King told some 250,000 people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in the US capital. \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" Four words -- \"I have a dream\" -- thundered through his speech and entered into the American lexicon as symbols of the pursuit of racial equality in America. Some 40 years later, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign is putting that concept to the test. The Illinois senator -- the only African American presently in the Senate -- addressed the sensitive race issue directly in a recent speech in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that drew parallels with King. Obama's remarks were \"the most important speech on the question of race and the future of this country since Dr King's 'I have a dream' speech,\" said Chaka Fattah, a black Congressman from Pennsylvania. Several other commentators hailed Obama's address as historic. According to a CBS News opinion poll, 69 percent of Americans approved of the Illinois senator's speech, in which he urged an end to the country's \"racial stalemate.\" Obama also spoke eloquently about black \"anger\" and white \"resentment\" at a time when divisive talk about race threatened to engulf the presidential campaign. \"I have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle,\" Obama said. \"But I have asserted a firm conviction ... that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds,\" said Obama. While 52 percent of Americans hailed King's \"great influence\" on civil rights -- with 75 percent of blacks and 47 percent of whites saying so -- some 39 percent of blacks said the country still had \"a long way to go\" towards racial equality, according to a survey of 1,012 respondents conducted by Ohio University. Throughout the country, religious ceremonies and university conferences will celebrate King's legacy, including an event at Tennessee's Vanderbilt University, where longtime human rights advocate and black activist Angela Davis will address the theme \"We are not now living the dream\" of Martin Luther King. (The report appeared on newsinfo.inquirer.net) --------------------- Forty years on, Obama, others still stand in King's shadow By John Railey By the spring of 1968, an exhausted Martin King was often tortured by thoughts that he would be killed. He harnessed his pain and pressed on. \u201CHe grasped the benefit of dramatizing his fight with death - and hence, his people\u2019s fight with social death as victims of oppression,\u201D Michael Eric Dyson writes in his compelling new book, April 4, 1968: Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Death and How It Changed America. \u201CKing never tired of telling black folk that unearned suffering, even death, is redemptive. \u2026 What we make of his death may determine what we make of his legacy and our future.\u201D Friday will mark the 40th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination on that Memphis hotel balcony. The anniversary has always been a more realistic occasion than the King holiday in January. The holiday is about sweet dreams. The anniversary is about whether America really is moving from nightmares to those dreams. This year, in addition to the big 4-0 number, Barack Obama\u2019s presidential run has given us all the more reason to ponder that question. Obama, with his mix of black blood and white blood, has forced America into a debate on race. But it\u2019s a debate that often gets dumbed down, just as King\u2019s radical dreams of peace, equality and justice have been dumbed down. King\u2019s hard legacy was quickly wrapped in soft myth. \u201CBefore his body was even laid to rest, Martin Luther King Jr. had slipped into the long night of myth,\u201D Dyson writes. \u201CHe quickly became the most overworked martyr since Abraham Lincoln.\u201D And \u201Cmartyrdom also forced onto King\u2019s dead body the face of a toothless tiger. \u2026 In exchange for collective guilt, whites have given King lesser victories: a national birthday, iconic ubiquity, and endless encomiums,\u201D Dyson, who is black, writes. \u201CBut blacks have not been innocent in the posthumous manipulations of King\u2019s legacy. If whites have undercut King by praising him to death, blacks have hollowed his humanity through worship. \u2026 Whites want him clawless; blacks want him flawless.\u201D Amen. Dyson writes about how Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, despite what Dyson depicts as strong efforts, have failed to fully carry out King\u2019s dreams. You think? Dyson could have found a few other black leaders to explore. Regardless of what their inflated egos might lead them to believe, Jackson and Sharpton don\u2019t speak for all black folks any more than James Dobson and Pat Robertson speak for all white folks. Dyson writes that because \u201CKing and Jackson fought bitter battles with ugly forces, Obama can gracefully walk through doors kicked in by King and Jackson.\u201D Jackson did fight those battles, at least in his days as one of King\u2019s lieutenants. But Sharpton\u2019s fighting, often just for the sake of publicity, has accomplished little except to further divide the races. And how about all the anonymous blacks and whites who paved the way for Obama\u2019s presidential run? Dyson does seem to get that point. \u201CAs he walks through those doors, Obama carries the legacy of his people even as he seeks to serve the entire nation. There could hardly be a more fitting tribute to King, and to the people and justice he loved.\u201D It\u2019s a grand vision, anyway, that suggestion that Obama could sweep into the White House, buoyed in large part on the dreams of another charismatic black leader. For Obama to have made it as far as he has is a huge statement in and of itself about how far we\u2019ve all come. And regardless of whether we\u2019re backing Obama, we can all hope that 40 years after King\u2019s assassination, a black leader shouldn\u2019t have to worry whether he\u2019ll have all the time he needs to play out his hand, for better or worse. He shouldn\u2019t have to worry that he\u2019ll be killed for the color of his skin in a land that proclaims freedom for all.

I will stay more abstract in this comment. This picture was drawn for a heartbroken person. But I really fail to cheer up people. Ok, that was too sarcastic. Of course this is not a cheer up! picture. It's about that drowning, free falling, icecold, desperate drop when people vanish that are dear and important to you. And there is no turning back. If one doesn't break free on own accords, there is this spiraling down and turning numb of cold and becomming empty. Of course, there also is a lot of Bosch-Reference, due to the nightmarish world that goes on in the first breath of emotional war... but turns cold as well. The last valentine's card I drew was way more happy but strangely, very, very close to this one. I just realized that.

I like the new grid, but the missing title which you only see when hovering over a thumbnail and a few other small issues still bug me.

O Ka-Fée is the term concerning all my paintings done with coffee. It concerns the way of painting and of obtaining textures with coffee. It's about projections of coffee, which once in stains on the sheet, undergo injections of pigments. (Powder, colorex, watercolor.) Textures realized by coffee by drying (more or less sweetened) are unique, they are more interesting than those realized with water. The coffee is a rather complex medium has to master, it's necessary to know its reactions to be able to manipulate it with pigments, we learn it every day. O Ka-Fée also concern my graphic style and the whole universe which gets free of it. It's for that the term is my own brand.

So I thought I'd go all out with the colours. This contest was perfect for me because i was aching to do something really colourful after a run of black and white..ish ones. Looking for inspiration I started listening to music. After going through my most psychedelic stuff I put on a song I listen to pretty much daily and thought \"hey! this song is pretty grand and colourful and sunny and works well with what I've got\" (those were the criteria lol). The song was \"Luv Your Life\" by Silverchair and i was going to call it that but changed my mind.. If you've ever seen the video clip for it you could tell i drew inspiration from that. I knew the style that i wanted the psychedelic stuff to be in but had no idea what it was going to be or how it would fit in a picture. So I came up with the old gramophone and then everything fell into place. I went the surreal\/cartoony way after originally intending it to be more realistic. I just love the idea of this absolutely massive gramophone on the top of the greenest hill, surrounded by the other greenest hills, in the middle of nowhere, in the late afternoon sun...doing this lol. How cool would it be to see it!! oh the scale (its probably not easy to tell) : i tried to make it as though a tree would be halfway between the base and the actual record.. Damn scanners and their grainy translations of coloured pencil haha. But Im pretty proud of how it ended up.

This work was a commission for a friend, whose only direction was \"your version of a world map\". Initially I was planning a more abstract painting or drawing. But I really love ancient and medieval maps, the way they were so impossibly detailed and whimsical, often with huge sections of the world remaining mysteriously uncharted. I did a lot of research, looking at what must have been hundreds of examples, all wildly different. I actually went to an exhibition of some of the world's greatest maps and was truly inspired there. What fascinated me most were the bizarre mythological creatures conveniently slotted into the unexplored waters, as well as the sometimes absurd surrounding detail and the \"almost but not quite\" shapes of the countries. They were generally pretty eccentric \u2013 much more interesting than our boring contemporary maps. So I took all that away, and started thinking about mine. Because I could never just do a straightforward map, I decided to contextualize mine within a kind of hypothetical alternate history. I invented a language that seems to sit somewhere between Tolkien, Shaun Tan and astrological symbols. Unfortunately I don't have the skill to translate it. The idea was that this map was produced by an ancient extraterrestrial race with esoteric knowledge of the planets and stars. Perhaps they arrived on Earth travelling between dimensions, mapped what they saw and then left before they were able to finish. I spent approximately 4 hours a day for a month on this map. I certainly didn't take the easy road and so it owned my life. But I'm really happy with how it turned out Hopefully it translates on screen. ~Simon Follow my page on Facebook: facebook.com\/simanion Instagram @ simanion","medium":null,"title":"Terrestria Simanion Watch Traditional Art Drawings Fantasy Simanion","url":"https:\/\/simanion.deviantart.com\/art\/Terrestria-432118251\/?purchase=print&itemids=186","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Fantasy"],"filename":"Terrestria Simanion Watch Traditional Art Drawings Fantasy Simanion_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$95.75","artistURL":"https:\/\/simanion.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/734b\/th\/pre\/f\/2014\/036\/9\/3\/terrestria_by_simanion-d759skr.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"petersen1973","description":"This was inspired by the works of Edward Hopper.

You won't have to buy it or anything. Other Project WE sketches: [link] The answer to the chosen question is: 5. Project WE is not about romance. The old answers were: 1. It's not about vampires 2. There are no zombies either 3. Not even cannibals 4. I did not base the blue eyed character off of me, my friends, or you If you have a question about the secret Project WE, ask and I might just answer. But they must be questions like \"is this about demons?\" or \"will there be magic?\", and not questions like \"what is this about?\" or \"What is the name of the character.\" Basically, they must be yes or no questions. I will only answer one question for every new post, and the answer will be a \"no\" like \"no, there is no demons, etc\" If I didn't choose to answer your question, that might either mean the answer is a yes, or your question didn't get picked hahaha, I'm keeping things ambiguous.

This is the apartment of Dexter Morgan from the series \"DEXTER\". . Note 1: The biggest problem with this design has been the bathroom. The whole set of Dexter (both inside and outside) was built entirely on a soundstage from the first episode. However the bathroom never appeared except in the eposide in wich Dexter climbs to the window of the bathroom to enter in his house. But in this sequence only this window and a part of the bathtub was shown. In the beginning of the 6th season the bathroom appears a little bit more (when Dexter gives a bath to his child) but nor completely. And in fact the modification of the apartment (adding an entry to the other apartment) has changed the shape of this zone. I based the bathroom in this image: i49.tinypic.com\/f2olv.jpg This is a production piture of the set as it was designed and constructed from the beggining but never used completely. Note 2: If you see the exterior of the real apartment (in 1155-103rd Street - Bay Harbor Islands - Miami) you can count 4 glass \"segments\" to the right of the entry door. But if you see the series or a picture of the exterior set built in the soundstage you can count 5 segments. i50.tinypic.com\/2w7hncl.jpg The designer probably make this change to make a bigger interior. And I drawn the floorplan with this proportions. . Some sets have changed throughout the different seasons and this floorplan is a mixture of various of them. This is a hand drawed plan, in scale, coloured with colour pencils and with full details of furniture, fabric, timbers and complements\u2026 The design is made according with the \u201Creal\u201D apartment respecting the spaces, proportions, furniture and objets presents in the studio set. .

One day a man took her seal skin as she was bathing in the shallow waters and she soon became the wife of the lonely fisherman. She spent her days as a good and loyal companion to the man until one day she found her skin and she returned to the sea as seal once again. For this was her destiny, to fill the heart of a lonely man with love and service until she was called back to the sea. This original was created using watercolors on Arches 140lb cold press paper.

He named the nameless hills and dells; He drank from yet untasted wells; He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, And saw a crown of stars appear, As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head. The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty Kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin, who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin's Day. A king he was on carven throne In many-pillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shown forever far and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote; There forged was bladed and bound was hilt; The delver mined the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale And metel wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in horde. Unwearied then were Durin's folk; Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold; No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin's halls; The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-d?m. But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere; There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep.

Since there was a cat for the sun picture, I figured that it would be appropriate to use a wolf for the moon. The figure's face I tried to keep in half shadow, reminiscent of the moon itself. Also I liked the fact that the moon is supposed to represent the female qualities along with hidden traits. The water being dark, reflective, and hidden, with only a few reflecting lights, was much like the night sky itself with the female representation of the moon standing within it. This is a combined media project of watercolor and digital, as you can tell by the moon and stars. Most of it is watercolor, but I discovered that you could print out base colors onto watercolor paper, so I printed out the moon too. After scanning it I enhanced it a bit more in photoshop with the stars and such. Unfortunately the conversion from tiff to jpg made the colors darker and dingier than I wanted. For reference I used a photo of a dear friend and model from my own stock on LinzStock <img src=\"https:\/\/tn1-1.deviantart.com\/fs19\/150\/i\/2007\/239\/b\/2\/Stream_Maiden_06_by_LinzStock.jpg\"> I figure if I'm going to ask others to follow the rules, then I should too","medium":null,"title":"Sisters of the Moon LinzArcher Watch Traditional Art Mixed Media Fantasy LinzArcher","url":"https:\/\/linzarcher.deviantart.com\/art\/Sisters-of-the-Moon-69251819\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Mixed Media","Fantasy"],"filename":"Sisters of the Moon LinzArcher Watch Traditional Art Mixed Media Fantasy LinzArcher_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/linzarcher.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/2b2a\/f\/2007\/311\/1\/2\/120938500c8a6670.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Rimfrost","description":"I got inspired by the My Dying Bride song \"For My Fallen Angel\" That song makes me cry..it's so sad.....

I always wondered what unspoken thought could hide behind her pale forehead, what mysterious secret could drive me hypnotized to the depths of her pupils. One day at in a sudden impulse I grabbed a random blank canvas and started to sketch my Queen again. I painted during one month. Feverishly. I struggled with the hues to keep her face cold but still feel the life breathing underneath. I blew wind in her hair and colored her lips with purple. I spent tenth of hours with tiny brushes to carve the surface of her mechaorganic coat. I reworked her eyes several times until I felt trapped in her look again. But I still wonder so many things about her. Close-ups here Reference drawing here Related scrap here *edit* I was much pleasantly surprised this morning to find out my Queen had been featured as a daily deviation.

The two figures (both MEN by the way) are Lucifel (my rp character version of him, not the bible one), and Pain, the judgement angel who belongs to * mistressofspam. These two are the most evil duo about, despite the fact they look like light and dark personified. They are violent lovers, partners in crime, master and slave, brute strength and cunning.

But I actually couldnt find any valid size estimate for guidraco anywhere except that the skull is 38 cm long. I used the skull size therefore to create the scalebar. But it looks still so small, ok the skull comes from a juvenile but still, I always imained guidraco a bit bigger than that. Wingspan probably would be .....around...3 metres I guess...? Not quite sure. However I think the animls itself turned out beautifully, especially the head, I really like how this one came out. Guidraco vmeans maliscious ghost dragon which is one of the coolest names ever for a ptrosaur. It had huge elongated teeth in its mouth front indicating a piscivorous lifestyle. PS: So far I have only 2 requests from you, one is especially unusual since it is about the californian turkey?! The other is cearadactylus.

I can't stand most dog breeds (or dogs in general) and seeing how batshit crazy people went with dog breeding doesn't make it any better (and WHY do you even have to continue this bullshit with cats, too? At first we only had these ugly persians and hideous hairless sphynx cats, now there are those so called munchkins and kangaroo cats. Just...don't. We fucked up the dogs and gold fishes already. And as always, it is the animals who suffer. For what. For \"beauty\"?) If you happen to own a breed on the list above, please don't feel offended by that. I know that this could be a very delicate topic and i respect your opinions whatever these may be. Same goes for my opinions, though. And these would be: Health first. Then character. And THEN you can think of outer appearance (also: No. I'm not lumping all breeders of the world together here. There is more than black and white. Fact is, though, that some actually went way too far with pure breeding and standards as so many pitiful canine individuals show everyday.) Speaking of the German Sherpherd: The critter satirised here is the showdog version with that total overbred slanting butt\/back. The working dog versions at least do have some normal anatomy... Dog breeds had a purpose at one point in time and i'm totally fine with that. It's the show dogs i despise and where everything went overboard.

Two of these species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia. Members of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the largest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin, 1.5\u20135 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400\u2013600 g); and a large horn. Rhinoceros are killed by humans for their horns, which are bought and sold on the black market, and which are used by some cultures for ornamental or traditional medicinal purposes. East Asia, specifically Vietnam, is the largest market for rhino horns. Rhino horns cost as much as gold on the black market. People grind up the horns and then consume them believing the dust has therapeutic properties. The horns are made of keratin, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails. Both African species and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns, while the Indian and Javan rhinoceros have a single horn. The IUCN Red List identifies three of the species as critically endangered.

Really I do if anyone out there is shitty I can\u0092t credit for that idea\u0085 -it cant be helped- When I started this I loved how the face and jelly snakes came out\u0085 I\u0092m so proud of my shading, it look very real and alike the photographed jelly snakes but then I started to have a block and really died on ideas\u0085 I started fiddling around with this background grungy look and ripping bits out of a newspaper\u0085 Then one thing led to another\u0085 I do not really like this an awful lot, it lets me down for several reasons\u0085and it may be hard for your guys to see what\u0092s exactly happening This image was heavily created to \u0096nine inch nails- one of my fav bands \u0096as most- and listening to the lyrics on the album \u0096fragile- along to the soothing musical business the image came to be as it is\u0085 The girl reminds me of a young medusa, like medusa\u0092s daughter or perhaps medusa when she was young she has power and strength although a inner sadness\u0085..a longing, for she can not look at anyone without turning them into stone, *as medusas power goes* and everyone fears her powers, so no one looks at her beauty to see what she is really about. She rebels, scratching ink into her skin, showing her pain on the outside\u0085 and perhaps taking drugs to ease her pain? \u0096the syringe butterflies- It\u0092s like her drugged up world\u0085 beauty falling from grace\u0085 The skies are full of dark clouds and ravens screaming\u0085 I think she is looking for someone. I used Faber castel watercolour pencils and dirty paint brush water add some black ink I do think its funny, my images lately have been very in love And that simply is because I am very in love\u0085 But that\u0092s what you get my art reflects me, and my moods. enjoy xoxo","medium":null,"title":"see past my poisoned eyes glittersniffer Watch Traditional Art Other glittersniffer","url":"https:\/\/glittersniffer.deviantart.com\/art\/see-past-my-poisoned-eyes-30756040\/?purchase=print&itemids=85","tags":["Traditional Art","Other"],"filename":"see past my poisoned eyes glittersniffer Watch Traditional Art Other glittersniffer_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$182.00","artistURL":"https:\/\/glittersniffer.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/df19\/i\/2015\/127\/f\/1\/see_past_my_poisoned_eyes_by_glittersniffer-dib7ig.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"mykeamend","description":"36x24 painted in acrylic on wood panel.

And while I hugely regretted doing that, there's no point crying over spilt milk, you just have to keep on rolling. So I did! I also rotated it loads to get the angle right, and after a long time having it upside down, I decided that the original way up was best. I also bought new yummy gold paint which reflects really beautifully when the light hits it (but also has the consistency of glue -____-). It accidently got left on the brush, because I carelessly forgot to wash it and it ended up drying rock hard and now the brush is totally dead.

Why did I choose to illustrate from Rupunzel? Because her hair is freaking long. Yep, it's the hair. Can you imagine having SO MUCH HAIR? I always wondered why she didn't just cut it herself, hang it out the window, and climb down herself. Anyway, I tried to imagine what it would be like to have hair about 5 stories long, and thought about how much trouble it would be to style. So I imagined poor Rapunzel practically getting engulfed by her own hair. OK, enough about inspiration. All I have to say now, is that the next painting I do.....no hair. I got so tired of painting hair! *shakes fist at Rapunzel!* It took about 3 hours just to paint her hair..... watercolor and colored pencil on paper Link to the Brother's Grimm Contest [link]","medium":null,"title":"Let Down Your Hair Isynia-Artessa Watch Traditional Art Paintings Illustration Storybook Isynia-Artessa","url":"https:\/\/isynia-artessa.deviantart.com\/art\/Let-Down-Your-Hair-27742761\/?purchase=print&itemids=19","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Illustration","Storybook"],"filename":"Let Down Your Hair Isynia-Artessa Watch Traditional Art Paintings Illustration Storybook Isynia-Artessa_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$96.00","artistURL":"https:\/\/isynia-artessa.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/1b6c\/i\/2006\/015\/9\/5\/let_down_your_hair_by_isynia_artessa.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Blue"],"artist":"RT3D","description":"ARTIST:RAFI TALBY rafitalby.webs.com","medium":null,"title":"Abstract space by rafi talby RT3D Watch Traditional Art Paintings Abstract RT3D","url":"https:\/\/rt3d.deviantart.com\/art\/Abstract-space-by-rafi-talby-469675136\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Abstract"],"filename":"Abstract space by rafi talby RT3D Watch Traditional Art Paintings Abstract RT3D_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/rt3d.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/8ed8\/i\/2014\/202\/3\/6\/abstract_space_by_rafi_talby_by_rt3d-d7rmrnk.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"agnes-cecile","description":"?E Emiliano Ercoli - www.facebook.com\/ercoliemilian\u2026 The man behind all the music in my youtube videos : www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zypgzx\u2026 watercolor, acrylic and pen on watercolor moleskine notebook (200g) 40cm x 30cm YOUTUBE | TUMBLR | FACEBOOK","medium":null,"title":"my musician agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Portraits agnes-cecile #emiliano #moleskine #silvia #watercolor #agnescecile #ercoli #pelissero #emilianoercoli","url":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/art\/my-musician-519128903\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Portraits"],"filename":"my musician agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Portraits agnes-cecile #emiliano #moleskine #silvia #watercolor #agnescecile #ercoli #pelissero #emilianoercoli_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$55.75","artistURL":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/a568\/f\/2015\/117\/d\/f\/my_musician_by_agnes_cecile-d8l2qfb.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"PixieCold","description":"\"You still broke my heart... again and again.... but i will love you always...\" You can buy the original painting!!!

It had large forearms that lead at first beeing suggested that it walked on all fours, however since it has been known that pronation of the hand was impossible in theropod dinosaurs this has been debunked. Xuanhanosaurus was a mid sized theropod, around 4,5 metres long and estimated at beeing 250kg heavy. Its classification is a bit controversial, it has traditionally been classified as a megalosaur but more recent research indicates a basal position within metriacanthosauridae which is even cooler since metriacanthosaurids are among my favourite theropods together with megalosaurids and tyrannosaurs.","medium":null,"title":"Xuanhanosaurus qilixiaensis Teratophoneus Watch Traditional Art Drawings Animals Teratophoneus #dinosaur #palaeo #reptile #sinraptor #theropod #exinct #szechuanosaurus #xuanhanosaurus #art #metriacanthosaurid #qilixiaensis (show more)","url":"https:\/\/teratophoneus.deviantart.com\/art\/Xuanhanosaurus-qilixiaensis-727534110\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Animals"],"filename":"Xuanhanosaurus qilixiaensis Teratophoneus Watch Traditional Art Drawings Animals Teratophoneus #dinosaur #palaeo #reptile #sinraptor #theropod #exinct #szechuanosaurus #xuanhanosaurus #art #metriacanthosaurid #qilixiaensis (show more)_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/teratophoneus.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/209f\/i\/2018\/025\/1\/e\/xuanhanosaurus_qilixiaensis_by_teratophoneus-dc15kwu.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"TaoBishu","description":"","medium":null,"title":"Chinese Traditional Flowers Painting TaoBishu Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery","url":"https:\/\/taobishu.deviantart.com\/art\/Chinese-Traditional-Flowers-Painting-451493757\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Landscapes & Scenery"],"filename":"Chinese Traditional Flowers Painting TaoBishu Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/taobishu.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/ce9c\/th\/pre\/i\/2015\/107\/c\/1\/chinese_traditional_flowers_painting_by_taobishu-d7gt2t9.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Black"],"artist":"ElenaShved","description":"","medium":null,"title":"Panthera ElenaShved Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals ElenaShved","url":"https:\/\/elenashved.deviantart.com\/art\/Panthera-728353616\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Animals"],"filename":"Panthera ElenaShved Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals ElenaShved_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/elenashved.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/4a25\/i\/2018\/030\/3\/f\/panthera_by_elenashved-dc1n58w.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":["null","null"],"artist":"skincandy9","description":"McLaren P1 Graphite on Hot Press Illustration Board Using Staedtler Mars Carbon pencil leads 9B-9H","medium":null,"title":"#2 McLAren P1 skincandy9 Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Technical skincandy9","url":"https:\/\/skincandy9.deviantart.com\/art\/2-McLAren-P1-460136221\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Illustration","Technical"],"filename":"#2 McLAren P1 skincandy9 Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Technical skincandy9_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/skincandy9.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/fff2\/i\/2014\/162\/9\/f\/_2_mclaren_p1_by_skincandy9-d7lybdp.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Sebmaestro","description":"This is another paradox that I've been working on for a couple of days.

It is perhaps best known for its appearances in films like Free Willy, and among most people for its great intelligence, fierce and innovative hunting techniques, and distinctive black and white appearance. There are five different 'types' of killer whale, depending on where they live, how they hunt, and so on. Killer whales have distinctive language dialects per pod and region, and have been described to have their own cultures. Killer whales are apex predators, and some will even target larger whale species for food; killing them through suffocation. Orca as a totem animal can represent: (not an exhaustive list) Energy of change and changing, adaptability, clinical and detached intelligence, balancing \u0091black and white,\u0092 rejecting simple truths, polarity, dialect and language, being a predator to get what you want, socialising, needing others around you, wolf of the sea.

My own slice of horror \u2014 an illustration to a marvelous 1884' novel \"Against Nature\" by J.K. Huysmans, also known as the Bible of the Decadence. Dark, aesthetic, captivating \u2014the book I'll be rereading for a million times. The picture is the antihero and his collection of world's most unnatural natural beauties :3 ...Two days later the carts arrived. The gardeners unloaded from their vans a collection of Caladiums whose swollen, hairy stalks carried enormous leaves, shaped like a heart; while keeping a general look of kinship, they were every one different. They included some extraordinary specimens, \u2014 some rosy-red, like the Virginale which seemed cut out in glazed cloth, in shiny court-plaster; some all white, like the Albane, that looked as if made of the semi-transparent membrane that lines an ox\u2019s ribs, or the diaphanous film of a pig\u2019s bladder. Others again, especially the one called Madame Maine, mimicked zinc, parodied pieces of stencilled metal coloured emperor-green, blotched with drops of oil paint, streaks of red-lead and ceruse: these, \u2014 the Bosphorus was an example, \u2014 gave the illusion of starched calico, spotted with crimson and myrtle-green; those, the Aurora Borealis for instance, had broad leaves the colour of raw meat, intersected by striations of a darker red and purplish threads, leaves that seemed swollen and sweating with dark liquor and blood. <...> The men brought other and fresh varieties, in this case presenting the appearance of a fictitious skin marked by an imitation network of veins. Most of them, as if disfigured by syphilis or leprosy, displayed livid patches of flesh, reddened by measles, roughened by eruptions; others showed the bright pink of a half-closed wound or the red brown of the crusts that form over a scar; others were as if scorched with cauteries blistered with burns; others again offered hairy surfaces eaten into holes by ulcers and excavated by chancres. To finish the list, there were some that had just come from the doctor\u2019s hands, it seemed, plastered with black mercury dressing, smeared with green belladonna ointment, dusted over with the yellow grains of iodoform powder. Then they got out of the carts a fresh batch of monstrosities, the Echinopsis, showing a pink blossom like the stump of an amputated limb rising out of a compress of cotton-wool; the Nidularium, displaying in its sword-like leaves gaping, ragged hollows; the \"Tillandsia Lindeni,\" like a broken-toothed cury-comb, of the colour of wine-must: the Cypripedium, with its involved, incoherent, incongruous contours that seem the invention of a madman. It was shaped like a wooden shoe, or a little rag-bag, above which was a human tongue retracted, with the tendon drawn tight, as you may see it represented in the plates of medical works treating of diseases of the throat and mouth; two miniature wings, of a jujube red, that seemed borrowed from a child\u2019s toy windmill, completed this grotesque conjunction of the underside of a tongue, colour of wine-lees and slate, and a little glossy pocket, the lining of which distilled a viscous glue. <...> These, however, he barely glanced at, waiting impatiently for the series of plants that particularly fascinated him, those vegetable ghouls, the carnivorous plants, \u2014 the Flycatcher of the Antilles, with its shaggy edge, secreting a digestive liquid, provided with curved thorns folding into each other to form a barred grating over the insect it imprisons; the Drosera of the peat mosses, furnished with rows of stiff, glandulous hairs; the Sarracena; the Cephalothus, with deep, voracious cups capable of absorbing and digesting actual lumps of meat; last, but not least amazing, the Nepenthes whose eccentricity of shape overpasses all known limits. <...> \"All the same, these plants are amazing things,\" he muttered to himself; then he stepped back and embraced in one view the whole collection. Yes, his object was attained; not one of them looked real; cloth, paper, porcelain, metal seemed to have been lent by man to Nature to enable her to create these monstrosities. When she had found herself incapable of copying human workmanship, she had been reduced to mimick the membranes of animals\u2019 insides, to borrow the vivid tints of their rotting flesh, the superb horrors of their gangrened skin. \"It is all a matter of syphilis,\" reflected Des Esseintes, his eyes attracted, riveted on the hideous marking of the Caladiums, lit up at that moment by a shaft of daylight. And he had a sudden vision of the human race tortured by the virus of long past centuries. Ever since the beginning of the world, from sire to son, all living creatures were handing on the inexhaustible heritage, the everlasting malady that has devastated the ancestors of the men of to-day, has eaten to the very bone old fossil forms which we dig up at the present moment. Never wearying, it had travelled down the ages, to this day it was raging everywhere, disguised under ordinary symptoms of headache or bronchitis, hysteria or gout; from time to time, it would climb to the surface, attacking for choice badly cared-for, badly-fed people breaking out in gold pieces, setting, in horrid irony, a Nautch-girl\u2019s parure of sequins on its wretched victim\u2019s brows, inscribing their skin, for a crown to their misery, with the very symbol of wealth and well-being. And lo! here it was reappearing, in its pristine splendour, on the bright-coloured petals of flowers!","medium":null,"title":"A rebours Ink-Yami Watch Traditional Art Mixed Media Conceptual Ink-Yami","url":"https:\/\/ink-yami.deviantart.com\/art\/A-rebours-629636948\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Mixed Media","Conceptual"],"filename":"A rebours Ink-Yami Watch Traditional Art Mixed Media Conceptual Ink-Yami_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/ink-yami.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/0335\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/357\/a\/d\/a_rebours_by_ink_yami-daevaz8.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"Leonidafremov","description":"This is an oil painting on canvas by Leonid Afremov made using a palette knife only.

This painting was done for my younger brother's new electronic duo, Twin Caverns, to be used wherever they like. Their music is pretty chilled, down tempo, ethereal electronic stuff with haunting, floating vocals by Louise Millar combined with more gritty hip hop beats. Some kind of mix between Massive Attack, London Grammar (especially in guitar sound), Chet Faker and a touch of soul. Anyway, I wanted the painting to reflect their music in being dreamy, flowing and simple in form, but heavily textured and peppered with electronic detail. I think they were pretty happy with it I really love this kind of abstract painting. Building a world out of flowing lines and broad areas of colour and then clarifying parts with detail and contrast. I don't do it that often, but it may pop up more now, at increasingly larger sizes. If it sounds like your thing and you wanted to check out Twin Caverns, I thoroughly recommend you do! Only a few songs up so far with more coming soon.

Cute little guy, isn't he? So I got some news for everyone! One of my friends started a site called Pixery that's blowing up in popularity. They make shirts out of your artwork and designs. The thing that makes it awesome is the artist gets a percentage of the sale and the rest goes to a verified cause of the artists choice. So every time you buy a shirt from my store you not only get an awesome shirt that is high quality, you get to give back and do some good! I chose Visalia Feral Cat Coalition, which is a group I've been volunteering for years. It's a non profit organization that trap, neuter, and return feral cats to where we caught them. We also arrange people to feed the feral colony daily and make sure they're healthy, we even provide medical care if needed. It's great for the cats since they won't be reproducing, over populating the area, and it saves lives. Most feral cats are euthanized when an area gets overpopulated by ferals, it's heart breaking. But with TNR the cats can live out their lives in piece. It's also great for the local people because the cats stop fighting and spraying. We've saved many lives doing this and both the cats and locals are happy! So just think, every shirt you buy will save another cats life!

I think I whinge about the scanner every time I upload something Although watercolour comes up waaay better than coloured pencils.

Over the years pilgrims would go to Jerusalem and walk the route Jesus took on his way to the cross, stopping at moments along the way to remember, reflect and pray. The Stations began appearing in the middle ages when pilgrims were forbidden to enter Jeruselem when it was occupied by the Turks. They made the Stations as a way to remember in Spirit back in their own countries. Long considered only a Catholic tradition, they are now finding a popularity across all traditions. These are my versions.

(and their effort was especially magnificent with the colors of the universe´s nebulae, as you know.) next time when you see the happiness of a rainbow or the shimmer of the northern light, you´ll know that the colorfoxes are on the prowl again. watch closely - maybe, you even recognize their shape behind the colors.\" (always a yay for crappy translations ) ...i bet this picture will make your eyes bleed! messy, sloppy, spontaneous, speedpaint (but geez, it was SO fun!) but if you have read the lump of text above, you know at least that this was purposed oil on canvas","medium":null,"title":"Where Colors came from Culpeo-Fox Watch Traditional Art Paintings Illustration Storybook Culpeo-Fox #alopecoides","url":"https:\/\/culpeo-fox.deviantart.com\/art\/Where-Colors-came-from-116123799\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Illustration","Storybook"],"filename":"Where Colors came from Culpeo-Fox Watch Traditional Art Paintings Illustration Storybook Culpeo-Fox #alopecoides_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/culpeo-fox.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/7b78\/i\/2009\/075\/9\/2\/where_colors_came_from_by_culpeo_fox.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Yellow"],"artist":"AlviaAlcedo","description":"Cold as ice..

I loved drawing this one very much and feel it came out good. Since the horse is all white I drew in a medium to dark toned background...I needed to use negative drawing for the mane and tail, this is done by leaving the white of the paper behind and drawing the darker tones around the area...you need to work a tiny area at a time very slowly. I had fun drawing in a background to look like trees in a forest, the reference photo had a nice DOF and was a pleasure to work from.

Thank you for suggesting my drawing gramarye! . Drawing is such a great love of mine. I have to tell you, when I was a child I had a friend named Jeanna Pace, she could draw horses better then anyone, she didn't use a reference either, she was an extremely talented artist. I would practice and practice all the time and only wished I could draw as good, how I admired my friend. I'm very happy with this new horse drawing and feel I've come close to what I envisioned as a child for myself.

The unicorn moon-sickle is nocturnal, and sports its showy plumage all year round. Only able to fly short distances, usually from branch to branch.

The mermaid and the doll in my art are two things that my father would strongly recognize as loved subjects by his son. I have the mermaid in thrall looking at the beauty of the doll, and have her hand caressing the dolls legs, as she being a mermaid has no legs, but a tail, and it seems there is a fascination that some mermaids have with legs. My father loved it.

The scan really murdered it, despite all my fiddling with the saturation, light, etc. Ak! A few people have mentioned that I could work with heavier paper to get more of a 'watercolor' look with my watercolor. Well, that might be the sane thing to do, but I'm afraid I am more interested in the particular look I'm getting from the stock, and the fact that it looks more like marker than watercolor is thrilling to me. So don't worry.... I don't *want* it to look like watercolor XD A few people also told me that the background had taken over my last piece, so I left this one more subdued and quiet. It looks better in the original, I am afraid. Also, that my technique was too light on the last one, so I worked to put more color into the figure. Do werewolves count as anthros?

Experts say that a find such as this is sure to astonish the religious world and also help to solidify the place of Pastafarianism amongst other major religions. The FSM icon was recently discovered by Chris LaMonica, a devout follower of the Pastafarian faith, who claims that he was \"lead to the holy location by His Noodly Appendage.\" Mr. LaMonica has decided not to reveal the exact location of the sacred relic in order to ensure it's protection. However, he has disclosed that it is in an underground room beneath an ancient Christian Church and that \"it's really dark and kind of scary without proper lighting.\" Judging by the actions of Christians in the past, Chris LaMonica feels that if he did reveal the location of the icon, they would surely destroy it, claiming the location and even the existence of such artwork as sacrilege. The ancient FSM icon was restored by Testing Point Design after months of arduous work. Other sacred discoveries of this nature can be seen at www.TestingPointDesign.com.

This image is about my pride for what I do, Drawing is just the thing that ive always had with me and I always enjoy doing it. I get sad or frustrated if I have not drawn in a few days \u0085 it keeps me busy and makes me the happiest little bunny in the world when I finally finish a work that I can sit back and look at. I love sharing it with other people\u0085 And I love mingling with others who share the same passion. I\u0092m REALLY upset with how the roses turned out\u0085 my scanner just really does not like red, it can handle the colour but if your shading with a few reds on a image in person it shows out very detailed and you can see the definitions between each shade\u0085 unfortunately my scanner just happens to shit all over my hard work and all you end up with is flat reds.. I might take a photo and upload the roses in scraps eventually to show how pretty they actually are I\u0092m very proud of them and I\u0092m just loving how well I\u0092m doing roses now\u0085 A few months ago I didn\u0092t know even how to start drawing a rose! \u0096giggles- Anyway is a shame I cant help but enjoy using red .. -a detail you may miss- the two girls on either side of the blonde are holding tattoo guns. Once again all three girls where drawn separately \u0085 The background, banners, my skull butterflies and roses.. All colouring with the exception of the background where done with watercolour pencils \u0096NO WATER ADDED- The background I painted with green and black acrylics.

After the battle, when the coloured standards hold no more promise of victory. Broken and torn, they proclaim nothing more glorious than the bodies of the dead that lay stained with the sepia earth around them. Bodies that were once men and women who followed them nobly to slaughter. For what is there left, when even the last mournful voices have faded, claimed by the cold embrace of silence? When those I have loved and cared for are gone and my very purpose for being is thwarted by the swords and bloodied cries of men whose lives I have tried to save? What thoughts are to be had when even the healer sits bleeding of a mortal wound, with no hand left to help she who tried so vainly to stand against the onslaught of war? Yet even after the battle, the clouds strafe away, the blood sinks into the dirt, and life slowly creeps back. Even after the battle, there is hope. ______________________________ A commission for one of the most generous people I've ever had the good fortune to come into contact with, this piece was no means easy, and fought me a lot during the first attempt in oils. The only time I've ever admitted defeat with a medium, the coloured pencil version was more successful, and the amount of work gone into this piece reflects the huge amount of respect I have for the commissioner and the amount I really felt for the character. This is Deluna, a healer, left dying on the battle field with none left to help her. As mentioned, coloured pencil on grey card, done a little bigger than my usual A4 pieces, with a lot of time and love spent on the detailing, so full view is muchly appreciated. My best pencil piece to date, I think. And it couldn't have gone to a more deserving person. Many thanks, Kim, I'm so happy you stumbled across my artwork one day so long ago.

Plenty more dragons in this one... My new camera isn't very good and has swallowed much of the detail, but you get the idea... Brigantia was an ancient Celtic goddess, identified with the Roman Victoria. In this picture I wanted to encapsulate the spirit of pre-Roman Britain: artistic, poetic, mystical and untamed.. I used my imagination on the details, designing my own motifs, although keeping to the spirit of Celtic art. I took the image in a fantasy direction with the costume. A real Iron Age warrior would have worn a sort of tartan tunic and trousers and a heavy woolen cloak fastened with a broach.

I have just recently moved to Colorado and during my moving experiences there was a fire occurring on the mountains where I live. The fire was called the Waldo Canyon Fire. It is amazing to see a fire\u0092s destructive and healing powers occur only miles away from where you live. There are now big black mountains with valleys of green earth that had not been touched. It is truly a great source of inspiration. As far as the painting goes, the trees in the background are supposed to be the scars left over from the fire. This is a lone wolf in the Rockies, a wolf that wants to call Colorado its home. The absence of the moon symbolizes this wolf standing alone in the wilderness, but without the moon he can see how many stars actually watch over him from above. He can find himself again in these stars. This is the hope that one day wild wolves will once again find a place to live in Colorado. I want to thank for allowing me to use his photo as a reference: [link] The background very difficult as I tried to draw burned trees left over from the fire. The sky was my favorite part though! So many stars! Mediums used: Watercolors, watercolor pencils and acrylic paints. Frame added in ps. Artwork © to Amanda Klammer.

The scenery from Ukraine was stunning, particularly the sunflower fields. Liev Shreiber, the director, said this about the sunflower field scene: \"That's the thing I'm most proud of in the movie. I knew I wanted to put the house in a special place, but everybody said to do the field would be prohibitive, because of the cost of C.G.I. But my production designer said, \"No - let's find out when they bloom.\" We couldn't find any field we could buy - too expensive. So we rented a plot of land from a farmer and sowed the seeds ourselves. We planted in May, and the sunflowers appeared magically in full bloom just in time. We built the whole shooting schedule around that!\" (Source: [link]) Ukraine's flag is blue and gold. The blue half represents the sky (hope), and the gold represents the country's wheat fields (prosperity). Could also be the equally stunning sunflower fields under a clear blue sky. Even Van Gogh would be inspired. I claim ethnicity, by way of Saskatchewan.","medium":null,"title":"Ukraine Sunflower Fields Laurazee Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery Laurazee","url":"https:\/\/laurazee.deviantart.com\/art\/Ukraine-Sunflower-Fields-181771760\/?purchase=print&itemids=120","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Landscapes & Scenery"],"filename":"Ukraine Sunflower Fields Laurazee Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery Laurazee_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$96.00","artistURL":"https:\/\/laurazee.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/72aa\/i\/2010\/279\/1\/4\/ukraine_sunflower_fields_by_laurazee-d307zzk.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Black"],"artist":"PixieCold","description":"Hey guys!

Long backstory incoming! So this is a drawing that I was kind of hesitant to do at first. A friend of mine wanted to get a picture of a Phoenix as a tattoo since before I met him. It's in memory of his best friend, who passed away when he was in high school and loved the mythology of Phoenixes. I really did not feel like it was my place to even offer to draw it when he first told me, because it was a friend I had never met and I just felt like I should stay out of it. But in the two years I'd known him he was never able to find a picture he actually liked, and had a very specific image in his head. So I finally said I'd give it a shot. Plus, if he had someone else draw it and the bird anatomy was too off... it would have bothered me for life So here is my take on a black & blue Phoenix. It is exactly what he wanted, by the way He is going to get it tattooed on his calf. Update : Here is the work in progress of the tattoo. Unfortunately it is very low resolution so it's hard to see, but it's looking nearly identical to the drawing. He's planning to get it finished in a few weeks. sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos\u2026 I do commissions!

This took me so long to complete, A matter of two days on and off\u0085 but it didn\u0092t help the fact I started to draw it so late in the night till 2.30am just about. Let me just begin with that I am extremely proud of my new creation, and so I should be considering I put loads of effort into it. When I take time to detail an image like this in color the choosing what color to use here and what color to use there takes up hours of my time. I feel images like this make able to express what I can really do with my work when I put my efforts into it. For inspiration I looked through my older artwork of when I use to draw old furry style, its crazy with weirdo creatures all over the place and ripped open chests with butterflies fleeing to escape the dark prisons of a rib cage. Sometimes I miss my older art but as this demonstrates I can use it to combine the old with the new and it turn successful. I was inspired to sit down and draw something that in a way reminds me of my school day artwork \u0096 my older stuff, the days when my best friends would draw with me and end up taking all my ideas. It kicks the ass of god loving girls who I never got on with that have decided to take over my style and be known for the dark drawer of my high school. If people like her believe that they can pull my art techniques off then maybe they should concentrate on this image. But never mind \u0085 there is a hidden message aimed at a particular person here so for everyone else don\u0092t rattle your brain about it. This image look amazing in person, most of my work can sometimes seem better once scanned and photoshoped up to the max but for this image\u0085 well I have hardly changed a thing. The original is drawn side to side, top to bottom with small black borders of an A3 piece of paper and the colors shit all over the scanners version really- especially the reds. I would defiantly recommend a close full size peek, besides its not a HUGE image really, I\u0092m especially found of the scattered butterflies wings which are each marked with tiny little skull patterns. Overall I like how its almost dark and twisted in some aspects but in others quiet bright and playful\u0085.. it suits me perfectly. Materials? Since people tend to ask. Watercolour pencils, Fine point liners Black ink My two very own hands and Lots of love.

I chose ceberus as my creature, and being that he's the guardian of the underworld, I picked a bunch of death\/underworld imagery for the theme. Much referencing of Dore's etchings of Dante's Divine Comedy to get ideas. The final will be done on black scratchboard with stippling. It may kill me. Edit: Two questions that appeared frequently in the comments which I wanted to address: 1-The piece was done in mechanical pencil on two layers of tracing paper. The bottom layer had the initial line drawing, the top had tone. I just scanned them both in on top of eachother. 2-I'm thoroughly astounded\/pleased at the reaction this piece has received. I never expected to see it on the front page! So, I'm going to leave it in my main gallery instead of putting it in scraps, even after I upload the final. Thank you all for the postive feedback! I'm happy to say my teacher was pleased with it as well. Edit2: I have received a LOT of requests from people to use this image as a tattoo.

Some proposed keys to understanding...: A pattern is the form that composes or generates each part, and each to the rest of the whole. A fractal is a pattern that repeats at ever increasing and\/or decreasing scale, that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is a smaller copy of the whole. A hologram is a 2D plane that generates a 3D space when it is illuminated in the right manner. Each part of the hologram contains the image of the whole, even if it is torn into pieces. Relativity is the perceptive theory that parts (i.e. space and time) are not in fact separate from the whole, but one continuum (spacetime). Despite the apparent separateness of things at the explicate level, everything is a seamless extension of everything else into an infinitely ornate magic carpet. To scope is to examine or investigate the range of one's perceptions, thoughts, or actions. A fugue is a musical composition (and\/or texture) in which a theme(s) is echoed successively through a multitude of differing voices forming a symphonic tapestry. The \u0091psychic-genome\u0092 concept, meaning \u0093genetic information of the mind\u0094, construes that organisms\u0092 DNA is intimately linked with the corresponding mind in ways that manifest in its habitual patterns of activity.

O Ka-Fée is the term concerning all my paintings done with coffee. It concerns the way of painting and of obtaining textures with coffee. It's about projections of coffee, which once in stains on the sheet, undergo injections of pigments. (Powder, colorex, watercolor.) Textures realized by coffee by drying (more or less sweetened) are unique, they are more interesting than those realized with water. The coffee is a rather complex medium has to master, it's necessary to know its reactions to be able to manipulate it with pigments, we learn it every day. O Ka-Fée also concern my graphic style and the whole universe which gets free of it. It's for that the term is protected by copyright. Please, respect my universe and work. \/ Version FR FAQ : Qu'est ce que O Ka-Fée ? O Ka-Fée est le terme concernant mes peintures réalisées avec pour base de café. Il s'agit de la manière de peindre et d'obtenir des textures réalisées par le café. Dans un premier temps ce sont des projections de café dans lesquelles ensuite on injecte des pigments. (Poudres, colorex, aquarelle.) Les textures réalisées par le café (plus ou moins sucré et selon la marque.) sont uniques, elles sont plus fortes et intéressantes que celles réalisées avec l'eau.

In jealousy, Set killed Osiris and hid his body in the Nile. Isis recovered Osiris' corpse and prepared him properly for burial but at the funeral, Set stole the body, hacked it into pieces and scattered the pieces across the earth. Her devotion being so strong, Isis recovered the pieces of the body and reconstructed the fallen god Osiris. In her grief, Isis transformed into a bird and circled in the air, crying out her sorrow and deep lament. The wind she made with her wings wafted over her husband and new life came into him and he was reborn. To me, this story talks about the way we can become fragmented - our lives are cut up and compartmentalized- and we become role players, filling various parts but never feeling whole. We need to breathe. We need to allow our souls to return to our bodies, and -in prayer or meditation, or in simply being still and quiet- we can rejoin our fragmented selves and become entire once again. --- 24\" x 36\" Mixed Media on Canvas 2007","medium":null,"title":"New World Isis AaronPaquette Watch Traditional Art Paintings Pop Art AaronPaquette","url":"https:\/\/aaronpaquette.deviantart.com\/art\/New-World-Isis-76574388\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Pop Art"],"filename":"New World Isis AaronPaquette Watch Traditional Art Paintings Pop Art AaronPaquette_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$177.54","artistURL":"https:\/\/aaronpaquette.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/4af3\/i\/2015\/126\/a\/2\/new_world_isis_by_aaronpaquette-d19l96c.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"KristynJanelle","description":"I am pretty pleased with how this one turned out!

I am sure this is inspired by one of my very favorite DA artists whose beautiful, antique looking illustrative work is just.... some of the best on the site. And some of my favorite, period. Usually, I am extremely allergic to warm colors, and so I resolved to start with a very warm, very dark wash and see where it went from there. With somewhat surprising results. I like some parts better than others, but on the whole (considering I hadn't the slightest idea of what I was doing) it turned out fairly well. I'm still waffling on the border. Leaving it alone makes the image much more open, and somewhat unfinished. I considered going over it with a dark green wash, which would close in the picture and pop the red forward like crazy. Or to just mat it with the image alone, and don't do a thing with the border, as it would be covered up.","medium":null,"title":"Sunset hibbary Watch Traditional Art Paintings Fantasy hibbary","url":"https:\/\/hibbary.deviantart.com\/art\/Sunset-66867572\/?purchase=print&itemids=85","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Fantasy"],"filename":"Sunset hibbary Watch Traditional Art Paintings Fantasy hibbary_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/hibbary.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/4579\/i\/2009\/033\/4\/f\/sunset_by_hibbary.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Green"],"artist":"GaryWard","description":"Oil on Canvas 30\" x 40\" Original available for sale.

Check it out! [link] Though it doesn't say so on the ebay listing, I will ship worldwide; the cost for shipping would just be a bit more. :} This is an image that's been over a year in the making.. sort of. In july-august of 2011 I tried to do an oil painting of a white horse head for my sister...tried and tried and tried and nearly sent myself to hospital from lack of sleep\/eating\/drinking etc. etc. I hallucinated that daleks were living in various shapes and colors and that river song and the doctor were having an argument about how the eye was painted. Yeah. It was that bad. I eventually gave up, but I'm the most stubborn mule you'll ever meet, so I thought \"hey, I'll just use a different picture of the same theme\".. another horse head...a different medium. I got permission from to use this photo [link] and I tried to paint it digitally. Tried and tried and tried... still failed... a couple months ago I tried again, same photo, but with colored pencils, a lot of turpenoid, and some smooth watercolor paper...yeah, failed that one too. So, about a week ago, I dug my heels in and decided to try one more time. I'm supposed to be taking a break from art, but for whatever reason I just really needed to prove to myself that I COULD still draw... I DID still have it in me, somewhere, to remember how to create... so, yeah. Here we go. Just black colored pencils on some vellum bristol paper. It's not perfect, and I didn't get every detail correct... but I think that's okay. I finished it, it's done, I won. Hah!

The trunk of the tree may be thought of as forming a vertical axis around which these worlds are situated, with ?sgard, realm of the gods, at the top and the Hel, located in Niflheim, at the bottom. Midgard, our world that is inhabited by humans, is located in the middle and surrounded by Jötunheim, land of Jötunn, both of which are separated by the ocean. According to Atiteco myth, The existence of the Flowering Mountain Earth precedes that of the world as it is known today. Before there was a world, a lone tree stood in the center of all that existed. As the creation of the world approached, the tree was impregnated and its branches grew a single fruit of each thing known to humankind. In addition to physical objects such as rocks, it grew lightening and even segments of time. As the tree bore more and more fruit, it was no longer able to support everything which grew upon it, and so the fruit fell, smashing open upon the ground and scattering seeds about. These seeds took root and grew, nurtured by the original tree and protected beneath its canopy, eventually crowding out the Father\/Mother (Ti Tie Ti Tixel). The Tree of Life, or Etz haChayim ( ?? ????? ) in Hebrew, is a mystical symbol within the Kabbalah of esoteric Judaism used to describe the path to God and the manner in which He created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing). The Kabbalists developed this concept into a full model of reality, using the tree to depict a \"map\" of creation. The tree of life has been called the \"cosmology\" of the Kabbalah. In kabbalah, Etz Chaim is a mystical symbol used to understand the nature of God and the manner in which He created the world. ~~~~~~~~ Kundalini (ku??alin? is ????????? in Sanskrit), literally \"coiled\". In Indian yoga, a \"corporeal energy\" - an unconscious, instinctive or libidinal force or Shakti - envisioned either as a goddess or else as a sleeping serpent coiled at the base of the spine, hence a number of English renderings of the term such as 'serpent power'. Kundalini is considered a part of the subtle body along with chakras (energy centres) and nadis (channels). The overall conception has many points in common with Chinese acupuncture. Yoga and Tantra propose that this energy may be \"awoken\" by such means as austerities, breath and other physical exercises, visualization and chanting. It may then rise up a subtle channel at the spine (called Sushumna) to the head, bringing psychological illumination. Each chakra is said to contain special characteristics. Yogis tend to attempt this alone, Tantrics in couples, both usually under the instruction of a guru. When Kundalini Shakti is conceived as a goddess then, when it rises to the head it unites itself with the Supreme Being (Lord Shiva). The aspirant gets engrossed in deep meditation and infinite bliss.","medium":null,"title":"Yggdrasil dennisdonohue Watch Traditional Art Drawings Surreal","url":"https:\/\/dennisdonohue.deviantart.com\/art\/Yggdrasil-96783235\/?purchase=print&itemids=19","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Surreal"],"filename":"Yggdrasil dennisdonohue Watch Traditional Art Drawings Surreal_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$24.95","artistURL":"https:\/\/dennisdonohue.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/d588\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/231\/7\/c\/yggdrasil_by_dennisdonohue-d1lmef7.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Mospineq","description":"Watercolor + ink Prints on Etsy: www.etsy.com\/listing\/202428830\u2026","medium":null,"title":"Unicorn Mospineq Watch Traditional Art Drawings Fantasy Mospineq #illustration #ink #unicorn #watercolor #butterfly","url":"https:\/\/mospineq.deviantart.com\/art\/Unicorn-480416631\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Fantasy"],"filename":"Unicorn Mospineq Watch Traditional Art Drawings Fantasy Mospineq #illustration #ink #unicorn #watercolor #butterfly_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/mospineq.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/0b24\/i\/2015\/106\/8\/b\/unicorn_by_mospineq-d7y0zuf.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," Blue"],"artist":"takmaj","description":"watercolor on paper from Italy hope you like it as much as I enjoyed painting it, and by this I mean a lot my other works: my facebook: www.facebook.com\/takmaj.majawr\u2026","medium":null,"title":"Procida takmaj Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery takmaj","url":"https:\/\/takmaj.deviantart.com\/art\/Procida-544025572\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Landscapes & Scenery"],"filename":"Procida takmaj Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery takmaj_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/takmaj.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/b678\/i\/2016\/153\/0\/4\/procida_by_takmaj-d8zwctg.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"GottaGetOut","description":"www.gastonvinas.com facebook.com\/gastonvinas youtube.com\/gastonvinas","medium":null,"title":"THE MIRROR IX GottaGetOut Watch Traditional Art Mixed Media Other GottaGetOut","url":"https:\/\/gottagetout.deviantart.com\/art\/THE-MIRROR-IX-63524858\/?purchase=print&itemids=85","tags":["Traditional Art","Mixed Media","Other"],"filename":"THE MIRROR IX GottaGetOut Watch Traditional Art Mixed Media Other GottaGetOut_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/gottagetout.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/c426\/i\/2008\/030\/f\/4\/the_mirror_ix_by_gottagetout.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"EvilineMoonflesh","description":"forest,oil on canvas, 2006","medium":null,"title":"forest EvilineMoonflesh Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery EvilineMoonflesh","url":"https:\/\/evilinemoonflesh.deviantart.com\/art\/forest-189143428\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Landscapes & Scenery"],"filename":"forest EvilineMoonflesh Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery EvilineMoonflesh_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/evilinemoonflesh.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/d7bf\/th\/pre\/f\/2010\/344\/a\/1\/forest_by_evilinemoonflesh-d34m004.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"zeruch","description":"an 'improvisation' using one base layer of acrylics and one layer of painteffects done with ArtRage and combined in Photoshop.

There is no color photo of this. My reference is a B & W photo on the back of the book \"The Early Ayn Rand\". It's a photo of her as she looked just having arrived in the United States from the Soviet Union (she was born in Russia), never to return, as she loved the United States passionately even before she got the hell out of the Soviet Union. Drab dress with a little tear, the kind of dress her hear-to-for wealthy family was reduced to after the Soviets destroyed Russia, nationalizing her father's pharmacy. I imagined all the color, and that surely she would have found a way to put some color, a flower or something in that torn dress. I don't imagine anyone would care about this painting unless they know her story. The greatest author and philosopher in history. Not a pretty woman, but she made a point of making herself attractive as she could during her great life. By the way her book \"Atlas Shrugged\" is the \"second most influential book for Americans today\" after the Bible, according to a joint survey conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club.

(But I figured October was a good time to paint it nevertheless.) Rather, Grim is the name of the raven; he is a character from the saga I\u2019m writing, the very first character I\u2019ve painted. (\u2018Grim\u2019 was a common personal name in medieval Scandinavia, meaning \u2018mask\u2019.) Here is the super-condensed story of Grim (so far): Up until he entered the saga, the life of Grim (then a man) was quite uneventful. Then along came a man who tried to feed him to a wolf. Grim had dreamt about this man beforehand, and when the man realized this, and realized that he needed Grim\u2019s help, he gave himself to the wolf instead (this man can\u2019t die, which comes in handy now and then). Along went Grim with this man, whose name was Kauras, north to Permia, where they found a giant who owned a magical horse, descendant, it was said, from Sleipnir himself. It was this horse Kauras wanted, and after a few cunning adventures he and Grim managed to defeat the giant. In doing so, however, Grim was mortally wounded. On their way north the two men had encountered an old women who understood what would happen to Grim; she had given Kauras a small piece of ivory, which she told him to put under Grim\u2019s tongue when he most needed it. Kneeling over Grim as he was dying, Kauras understood this was the time the woman meant; he put the ivory under Grim\u2019s tongue and instantly he turned into a raven\u2014a raven with a white tongue. Thus Grim survived a trip he thought he would not, and although his shape was now different, his mind was still that of a man. He returned with Kauras from Permia and has been aiding him ever since.I'm going to try to paint at least one character from the saga per month from now on, gradually working my way up to humans (for which I need more practice). Next I shall attempt Jarngeir (in horse-form), the giant who (almost) killed Grim. I\u2019m not all that happy with the way the spattering turned out. I think a spatter could have worked, but apparently I need to practice my spattering like I need to practice everything else. Ah well. Tomorrow is another piece of paper.

Title: True Love is Timeless Medium: Acrylic on canvas board Size: Approx. 11 x 14 inches There's also a song that goes with it titled, 'Ghost of a Rose' by Blackmore's Night. Here are the lyrics that were written on the back: \u0085she met her true love there, and she told him\u0085. She would say: ' Promise me, when you see a white rose you\u0092ll think of me, I love you so, never let go. I will be your ghost of a rose.' Her eyes believed in mysteries. ****** Her spirit wild, heart of a child, yet gentle still, and quiet and mild, and he loved her, when she would say: ' Promise me, when you see, a white rose you\u0092ll think of me, I love you so, never let go. I will be your ghost of a rose.' When all was done, she turned to run, dancing right into the setting sun as he watched her. And evermore, he thought he saw, a glimpse of her upon the rose forever, he hear her say: ' Promise me when you see a white rose you\u0092ll think of me, I love you so, never let go. I will be your ghost of a rose.'

I also tried for something a little different *coloring wise* ****I KNOW THIS IS REALLY PINK**** \u0085 and painted most of this image up! I use watercolor pencils but normally don\u0092t add much water\u0085so this time I decided to go a bit \u0096freer with colours\u0085and have a play! I also love using white out and white paint to add in some extra effect. This whole image has been one of my *lots of different bits and pieces artworks* .. Everything I draw is on A3 paper\u0085 and almost everything in this image was separate images all put together as one whole at the end! The border, the knife rack, the girl, the weirdo poodle thing, the background, the scrolls, the diamonds\u0085all drawn separately. I just try plan it all in my head and how I wish it to look and then draw pieces up at a time\u0085 scan them in and position them I just find I can\u0092t restrict myself to the A3 paper when drawing up these kind of ideas. I drew the scroll with the words on it last\u0085and I was worried I wouldn\u0092t have it fit in very nice\u0085 and it\u0092s now my favorite aspect of this drawing for some reason\u0085 -shrugs- I\u0092m happy with it. I used more patters that I bought from craft shops in order to do the nice wallpaper and dress patterns\u0085 I painted the white\/pink round border. I have to say that everything really did turn out better than I expected it to The scroll saying is from the \u0096Alice in wonderland movie- I was watching it while I drew *it helps inspire* and I thought the saying was rather fitting for the image It\u0092s been a while since I drew an image with some kind of fun freaky animal\u0085 It\u0092s almost tiring to draw cartoony spacked out animals for me\u0085 since I think that\u0092s all I use to do for years as a kid! And now it\u0092s kinda a chore\u0085 But at least I find it simple and almost boringly easy to do\u0085 AND it makes the image a bit more interesting OH I FORGOT TO MENTION...she has coke in her right pinky fingernail alittle pile of powder!!
