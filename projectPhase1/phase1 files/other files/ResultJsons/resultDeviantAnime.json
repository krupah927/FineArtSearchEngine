It was apparently very important, and she was certain she had accomplished it, but she could not remember anything about what it was or what had happened during it. Those details could have probably explained her current condition. She didn't always look like this, but over time her form had deteriorated as she lost her sense of self and forgot what she was supposed to look like. Was her name even Sana? Or was that someone else...? Oh well, it didn't matter. She had only one goal now: to return home. Even though she had forgotten many things, she still had one vivid memory of a bright blue planet with white marbling. With only this memory to guide her, she wanders the cosmos in search of any clues that could lead her to the blue star. --- Admittedly, Sana's backstory isn't very deep, but I also didn't really want to delve into it in order to preserve the mystery. I left both questions of \"What Happened to Her\" and \"What is She\" unanswered since I think there are a lot of interesting directions this could have gone in from a sci-fi angle. Is this the result of cosmic magic? Is she the suit itself? Or could this have been a complication of time travel? Additionally, I would have liked to provide some idea of how her journey goes, but I couldn't find a good way to segue into it. It'd be super boring if she just space-walked in a straight line for a million years through the void, so I imagine she actually encounters other folks on her voyage, like aliens and even humans, who try to help her locate the planet she describes. You'd think the space humans would recognize the description as Earth, but this doesn't seem to be the case, possibly because these folks have never been there or because it is no longer blue. Or maybe it is gone. OR MAYBE SANA IS THE PLANET (I am going to stop here). I listened to a lot of Space Dog while drawing\/writing this.

I always have pretty colorful pieces, so I couldn't leave it so colorless. I used two styles here... one was like at Cloud Strife and another one was more artistic, like at The Way I Feel. I wanted to see how they look mixed together. On the image are both characters one the same person... you can read character info below if you want to know more about him. And again I drew roses and butterflies... ah, I can't help myself. But for the first time I drew chain link fence... yay I wanted to make \"good\" and \"evil\" theme this time. Something about him: His name is Kyle and he have dual personality. When he gets angry, then he changes in evil, awful person... he gets black hair and his eyes changes to red. He would hurt even people who knows, because when he transforms, he don't remember what he did.

Hahaha...I change my mind a lot. You'll be able to see this in my video. Something about him: His name is Ari and he can transform into a black swan. When he's in human form he usually wears black mask shaped as a swan's head and he have long black hair with white and gray locks. He's a silent person and he doesn't like company. He usually spend days, weeks, months, years... in his small house, far away from villages and people, near small lake. And he's Jin's brother. I also recorded progress from this painting.

I started to paint it in August 2012, and yesterday I finally finished it. I guess it's time to submit it Maybe you can see some differences in styles, cuz since then I changed it a lot. And I think that here I painted the sea for first time...I have some drawings with water inside, but not like this. I simply wanted to design a mermaid character and now I did it. I painted whole piece with colors (not B&W ) and I used many brushes that it would look like this. I tried to paint this piece as much fantasy as I can...and I tried to paint jellyfishes as light which shows her path to the next mission... Something about her: Her name is Alexis and she's a warrior (assassin) mermaid. She has been trained to fight and to kill others, but she's not that much \"mean\". She have a magic sword and tattoo on her shoulder... when she starts a new mission then she calls her \"wisps\" which lead her to her goal. She lives in water and on the ground. When she calls wisps then her sword starts glowing with red light and wisps raise in front of her, showing her path.

It doesn't want to be wet, but turn on the facets and opens an umbrella. It wants friends and cuts out little people, then tears them apart. The gratifying pain is symbolized through the bleeding paper dolls. ~~~ I wanted to try a new drawing technique with this picture. It lacks the thin lines and smooth colors of my other styles. I drew it with a canvas texture but it's hard to see because of the small size on dA. The actual image is very big with detailed textured lines that looks like it was made with charcoal.

Redd is being charged with theft, assault with a firearm, and improper conduct in the presence of a lady. He is facing up to 20 years in prison, a twelve dollar fine, and a belly full of buckshot. The sheriff is venting plasma from his right arm pretty badly, but he\u2019ll be fine if he can get this shot off and incapacitate the red giant so he can tend to his wound. But the question is: can he hit a large, bright, stationary target in the open from less than 7 meters away with a shotgun? Only time will tell (SPOILER: the answer is yes). Landers & Redd are both specimens of a space-faring people I call \"Novakid,\" which is a no-good race of humanoid gas-bags. If you want to read more about them, I made an info dump full of fake facts in a thread here: [link] I came up with this idea by looking as ~Suweeka\u2019s sketch of aliens, and then from listening to too much Old Joe Clark. Then I was like \"OMG PUT COWBOY HAT ON STAR PEOPLE\" and lo and behold, it was done. The space genre can only benefit from more cowboys, in my opinion. This was a fun exercise in lighting. At one point I was thinking to myself \"wait, if these guys are glowing, why isn't any light showing through their clothes?\" and then I settled for their clothes being made of lead or something.

I had so many layers, so I had to make separate PSD files, with merged image...so, at the end I had around 10 PSD files for this work (I had to make them separated actually, cuz each file had almost 900MB or more ).

Or, alternatively, [link] Yan is a Candle Woman. Technically, she is 100% body fat, being composed entirely of lipids and fats. She becomes rigid and uncooperative at low temperatures, and lethargic at high temperatures (often just lying in a puddle of her own hair). The flame atop her head is an outlet for the energy she burns at the cost of her body mass. To this end, she requires a greasy diet in order to maintain her existence. It doesn't mean she eats rich foods necessarily (she cannot process carbs and proteins), but she does eat tallow like bread and drink oil like water. Steiner is a Lamp Man. He was created by dressing up a lamp post in a suit, and then given lectures on How To Be a Gentleman by a professor of Gentlemanology. And now he is the very model of chivalry. Ironically, though he emits light from his head for all to see, he is blind. Apparently that is how lamps normally are. Nobody knew this about lamps until they noticed he didn't seem to know what people were talking about and kept politely declining all invitations to move in any direction. Well, this was a fun picture to work on! In particular I enjoyed coloring and lighting this piece (which I guess is pretty much everything you see in it...?). I suppose more specifically, I enjoyed trying to make stronger shadows than I normally would. I think that will be something I'd like to work on more in the future: playing with the hue and saturation of shadows, and experimenting with the balance of it in the composition. I think I would also like to go to sleep Made in Flash EDIT: I was made aware afterwards that Steiner cannot contribute very well to an argument about what things look like. He can, however, speculate why!","medium":null,"title":"Incandescence JohnSu Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Vector JohnSu","url":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/art\/Incandescence-307060874\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Vector"],"filename":"IncandescenceJohnSuWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaVectorJohnSuimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/34df\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/170\/4\/5\/incandescence_by_johnsu-d52tdoq.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," White"],"artist":"Hyanna-Natsu","description":"Update: Woah DD!

This was my piece for a wonderful charity art book put together in order to raise money for St. Jude's Children Research Hospital. It was an inspiring project to be a part of, and the book itself is just breathtaking. This illustration, drawn back in April, was inspired by a sketch and my love for all things medieval. I'd also recently watched some of the Ivanhoe cartoon I loved when I was younger, hence the title. Unfortunately, the lute and the horn mentioned in the song referenced never actually made it into the picture. Drawing animals was a fun challenge and, while there are still a few things I'd tinker around with or improve on, this has turned out to be one of my favourite illustrations.

Now let's get to the business... This was done for and this year I was 's secret Santa These are her characters Vasper (left) and Strife (right). I liked them a lot, so I decided to paint them both. I tried to draw their expressions when Strife's sister ordered Vasper to kill him... but Vasper didn't want to kill him. So I tried to draw Vasper sad expression. This is flipped image, because like that composition looked better. Actually I drew it flipped (like that), but characters should be flipped in other way... so, now imagine them in right position And I drew butterflies and circles again... sorry, I can't help myself Because I drew it black and white from beginning I had SO much trouble with coloring it. Few days I tried (from morning till night) to color this properly... I have ton of versions for this drawing. But I like this the most, so I posted it here Adobe Photoshop CS6 tablet Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch Special Edititon M original size is 6298 x 4157 px I had 180 layers I drew it 17.5 hours (13.5 hours drawing, 4 hours coloring) and this was done for me (first image).

This is because she is a Bookworm - a creature who live on tales instead of food. Luckily for her, she's in no danger of running out of reading material. For as long as she could remember, she's lived in a great expansive Library with no windows and no doors, and only the small indigenous iflits for company. Were it not for the inexhaustible supply of books, she probably would have turned into mold long ago. ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACBookworms have 4 arms, 2 legs, and a pair of antennae. The first pair of hands are used for holding the book and turning pages, while the second pair are used for either supporting the head, picking the nose, or feeding tea to the main body (drinks are a luxury, not a necessity. Here she is drinking Mystery Tea, brewed from the pages of a bad mystery novel she didn't care to finish). One might at first think \"Hey, I can do all those things with just two hands,\" but one does not realize that turning pages for a Bookworm is a full time job, and how much work is involved in cleaning out their nasty nasty noses (they easily congest with plot twists). ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACThe antennae are used for \"self-insertion\" into books - a strange activity that allows the Bookworm to visit the world of the story they are reading. Aya looks for weak spots in the page's Fourth Wall and then bores into it with her antennae, after which she is able to channel herself into the world beyond the page. What does she do there? I don't know. But considering that she is an abomination and her primary drive in life is to be amused, she's probably up to no good. ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACThe legs are normal legs. Used for locomotion, just like a human's. They are very very pale, because there is no sun where she lives, but aside from that there's nothing special about them. ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACThe iflits are fiery little creatures. Normally the presence of fire-people in a Library full of flammable materials would be a concern, but iflits are pretty weak as flames go and for the most part try to conserve energy by not burning everything they touch. Their diet consists primarily of lipids and fats (Candelians do not like iflits. Not at all) and fiber. When Aya is done brewing tea, she will often feed the used pages to her iflits. As for candles, there is a gross cave somewhere in the Library where waxes come out of the walls and can be harvested for candles. It is a disgusting cave. Who put that there? Probably me. ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACAya and the iflits do not talk very much. Aya is more accustomed to absorbing knowledge than sharing it, so conversation does not come to her naturally. Also, iflits can't talk. However, they seem fairly intelligent and willing to cooperate, so Aya is able to form a sort of symbiotic relationship with them where she opens books and harvests easily consumable pages for them, as well as making candles for them from \"the Booger Cave.\" In return, the iflits heat her tea, provide her with reading light, and keep the Library from freezing over. Well, they would have done those last two anyways, since light and heat are just part of their metabolism. --- HOLY MOLEY those couple of paragraphs took me forever to write. I finished drawing this picture three days ago, and then spent all weekend coming up with ideas and writing them down and then being disappointed with how messy and unorganized it was, and I was just taking it way too seriously. In the end I said to myself \"Okay, it's already Sunday night. Let's just try to keep this simple and not go into detail about where the books come from and how she produces bookmarks and uses them. We'll talk about her legs.\" And there you have it. Did I actually spend more time on the description than the picture? The answer frightens me. Anyhow, hopefully this is not the last we see of Aya, since she was created for the sole purpose of being reusable and I actually want her to stick around for longer than all my other one shot characters. My work has a distinct lack of representatives.

I painted it with oils, but because I didn't have canvas and something like that, I painted it on watercolor paper. And I photographed this drawing with camera...I didn't want to scan it, because then I would have to connect it...I'm lazy to do that What is really weird, is that I drew sketch totally opposite. At first I drew traditional sketch, but then I drew another sketch digitally, but later, because I thought that I can make this drawing better traditionally, I drew another traditional sketch. Complicated, right?! And I drew it very long time...I started to draw it at 6 June and finished on 17 June. Well, before I wanted to paint something, I had to wait at least one day, till it was dry. That was with her tattoo...I drew it with black pen. I mixed many techniques together...

Congrats again... I did her character Remniel. In her story he lost his wing, so I kinda tried to illustrate that part. Oh my, and I'm sooooooooooo obsessed with red Anyway, I drew him with colors from beginning till the end. I did few concepts and I experimented a lot with composition. At first this drawing was portrait format. But then I decided to make it bigger and I did it in landscape format. I chosen central composition, but I still wanted that character looks dynamic. And it was really fun to do the necklace...shinny stuff. And I just realised that I have a lot of red haired men in my gallery... And while I drew this drawing I changed my style. I started to draw a little more realistic again (my last guys looked too much girly ), but I still used my anime painting technique. So I used many styles. And I drew hair with different technique also. Adobe Photoshop CS6 tablet Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch Special Edition M original size is 8494 x 5555 px I had 213 layers I drew it 19.5 hours <--also in HD wallpaper pack Details from this drawing you can check on our Tumblr account here.

As an orphaned thief growing up on the streets, he had little to no formal education and yet he can create things most other people would struggle to even imagine. While Xero tends to the bar and Meiro tends to the customers, Jun shuts himself away in his little workshop and tinkers with his machines. One day he'd like to build a flying machine that could lift him out of the sunless crater of Lower Asgard and out into the world. All three of them would float away high above the clouds and talk and laugh and marvel at the wondrous things out there. When it grew dark, they might even land in the cornfields of Xero's parents' farm and stop by for tea. This is the slightly older Boys Over Faeries version of Jun. In the time between this and In Fang and Thief Jun has become proficient with dual short swords and now sports a dragon tattoo on his back, courtesy of Meiro. On a shelf in his workshop sits a little puppet that a certain host made for his last birthday. The writing on the sign says 'STOP!' in the language of Albion.

It drops not because I stop draw but everytime I draw half of piece, I have new concept of that animal so I start again (the circle repeats at least 4 times ).

The crew is amused by the sheriff's colorful use of language - they have no idea what he's saying. The Gulliver Group ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACThe Gulliver Group is an all-female group (with the exception of their accountant and technicians) that was founded by their captain Lychee Sapindaceae. It was originally part of an undergrad project where she selected Adventuring as a focus for entrepeneurship. When it produced moderate success, she made it her fulltime occupation, bringing on board her closest classmates at the time. ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACThey travel from city to city, making a living off of odd jobs and Kill-20-Monsters quests. Then, before they have to start paying parking fees, they move to another location and repeat the process. This is also how they evade certain taxes (they are not popular with municipalities). ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACGulliver Group members in the picture besides Captain Lychee include B.B. Fayne (First Mate and navigator; she does not look where she is walking - not a good trait for a navigator), Getty Abarashi (Medic and cook; her degree was in animal husbandry but oh well), and Melissa DeFont (Bazooka Girl; she made up this job and joined on the condition that she could have it). The Sheriff's Posse ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACMarshall Barkrum is the sheriff of Lowtus County. He is a humorless man who does not know how to drive a conversation. He used to have a sidearm, but I forgot to draw it. But even without it, you can tell he is a tough and serious dude, as evidenced by his tough and serious wolf paw tattoo. ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACBarkrum and his posse try their best to keep things orderly, though characters like the Gulliver Group often give them trouble. He has at his disposal the artillery landship Arbitrator, but it is expensive to operate so he only brings it out when he needs to intimidate someone or discourage an attack. ã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACã\u20AC\u20ACPosse members include Henry Thurst (analyst and consultant; carries a laptop with him, is terrible in a fight. Maybe shouldn't be in a posse), Jorgus (grappler and secretly a huge fan of the Gulliver Group; he is trying to hide how super excited he is from his boss), and Mr. Huang (dunno what he does. Posse filler). Augh! This picture took wayyy too long. I finished it three days ago, and it took me until now to finish writing this up. I started drawing this back on the 8th, so it's taken about 3 weeks to complete. Setting aside time to work on art is hard with a full time job and competing distractions like games and manga! Well, hopefully all the time was worth it - I can say with confidence that this is my proudest piece so far. The Gulliver Group's airship has gone through 3 names. Originally \"Sea Gals\" was written on it. Then I was like \"wait, I have another idea!\" and wrote \"Gulliver\" on it. I probably tried that like 8 times until I gave up because the font kept looking really old-fashioned, so in the end I settled with the kanji æµ·é³¥ (umidori - \"sea bird\"). Not very clever, but it was an aesthetic I was finally satisfied with.

And when I thought it's all good, I messed up the inking that prompt me to create the 7th sketch. Thanks to this, I am literally taking my sweet time coloring, and now it's my record breaking picture. I took over 100 hours to finish!

I wanted to try another style, so it's a little different than my other paintings. Yea, lately I don't draw paintings with emotions, so now I decided to put emotions into this piece and not details, like I would normally do. This drawing I drew in record time...hahaha. I drew it just 6.5 hours. And I used Painter after 2 years I think... it's weird that I still remember to use it... lol. And this drawing I drew with colors (not black and white any more). I just didn't want to look at b&w colors again. Something about him: His name is Seth and like you see he's a little different than others. He have horns, so when he was little, his schoolmates used to laugh at him and make silly songs about him. But he's a nice guy, so that kind of things really hurt him. He lost trust for people and he normally stayed whole day in his home, just because he wanted to avoid people. Other info: He have long brown hair and on few places he have darker stripes on his hair (around his neck on left and right side). He have horns and big cat ears. He have a tattoo which is on his neck and he likes orange color (traditional sketch of him you can find in this post). Adobe Photoshop CS5 Corel Painter 12 tablet Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch Special Edititon M original size is 6000 x 4052 px I had 36 layers I drew it 6.5 hours This painting you can also find in book collection PRIME by 3dtotal. +CALENDAR 2013+ you can order and see preview in the shop here (you can see previews on the left thumb also). This image you can find inside the calendar. I hope you like it and comments are welcome EDIT: I quickly repainted his eyebrows, so now he looks a little bit more sad. It's not a big change... aaaaaaaaaaand... I posted downloadable PSD file from this drawing on my official site. You can download it here.

Thank you for loving her~ I finally finished this big piece...I started it last month (you may see the part reveiw couple of weeks ago [link]) but I was too busy to finish it after that. Can\u0092t really remember how much time it cost me (those fire nearly killed me...)...probably the most complicated one in this years. I'm happy I finally did a serious piece for my favorite princess. Six month ago, I did my very first piece of Princess Azula [link] and that recorded my first impression of her. At that time, my most favorite female character from the show was still Toph, but as I draw her more, I feel there are too much can be draw; as I read her deeper, I was totolly fasinated by this amazing character. Drawing other character is fun, but drawing her is kind of suffering...because she's such a tragic character. She wears a mask called \"perfect\" to cover all her loneness, fear and sadness. She once had everything but end up with nothing. All of those contrast making the drawing experience full of pain, sour, sympathy... Like higher you jump, more painful when you hit the ground. BUT, it\u0092s addicting too. I just can\u0092t stop drawing her... Azula needs love!! If no one loves her, let me be the one. I know she may looks bit OOC (out of character) in my style, but that's my perspective of princess Azula. Their are planty works out there to show her powerful, crazyness and threatening, which is part of her attraction too. But for me, I'd more like to present her perfection and mighty power, beauty and elegent as a menber of royalty, which not many people seems willing to draw. but I just love that, a true princess who got something she born with. whereas, perfect and tragic at the same time.

Thin lines. Anyhow, I had an idea to mess around with the cast of The Wizard of Oz after I first saw RIZ-ZOAWD, but never got around to doing it until last week. And then I didn't get around to finishing it until tonight. Well, let me reintroduce the characters to you here: 1) Dorothy\/Toto I fused these two together, partly because I wasn't particularly fond of Toto's role as the Small Barking Thing. In this version of the story, Dorothy does not survive entry to Oz and exists as an apparition, taking form only when possessing her dog's body. This is why she has dog ears and a dog tail in this picture. And she is also wearing a collar and has fleas (but you cannot see that). She is going to ask the Wizard of Oz for a body. 2) Scarecrow Scarecrow is kind of bigger than he needs to be, and his limbs are made of bamboo stuffed with straw. His job was to scare the crows, but after catching them all and then eating them, he has lost his purpose in life. He feels kind of dumb about that, so he is going to ask the Wizard of Oz for his brain. I mean, a brain. Scarecrow is not a picky guy. 3) The Tin Woodman The Tin Woodman is a giant living wood-cutting machine. He has chainsaw arms (or tapeworms, depending on how you look at them) instead of a hatchet, and a furnace in his torso for powering his blades. There are a number of errors with this character, like why does he have holes in his furnace door that lets the heat escape (EDIT: Apparently this is so oxygen can enter and let the fire burn)? And why hasn't the moss around the furnace dried up or burned off? Why is he burning fuel right now, but his arms not chain-sawing? And also he is clearly not made of tin, since he is rusting and that is what iron does. Well regardless, he is going to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart, because he hears those burn better. 4) The Cowardly Lion He is understandably afraid after the Tin Woodman separated his head from his body when he first attacked the party with the intent of eating Dorothy. He is a very large lion, and is very magical so his head can talk and float and oh it can survive (that last part is important for a head with no body). He was going to ask the Wizard of Oz for a body, but Dorothy said no, I am going to ask him for that, you have to ask for something else. Now he is not sure what to ask for. Everyone is telling him to ask for Courage but he does not really want that. Maybe he wants people to be afraid of him, even though he is only a head? A head with TEETH. Maybe he doesn't need to ask for anything. Maybe he will just wait for Dorothy to get a body, and then eat it, and he will laugh at her for being so eaten. Or maybe they will be friends. I don't know. I feel like I've used up my quota of words, so I'm going to wrap things up here and maybe link a few of the inspirations behind these character designs.

And I drew the same characters which you saw on + carpe diem + drawing. Only that for the first time I drew more environment than characters...and I used spiral composition for the first time I wanted to paint something colorful, again, and I always wanted to paint a sky city, so I finally did. Concept sketch for this drawing I drew in 2 hours I think, all other hours were spent for the details. And in this city I even drew children, who plays with kites...they are pretty small...haha. This city is called Therion and it's home by these characters. Something about them: Damien (far away, a little right where is statue) is a good guy and sometimes he can be pretty devilish. His weapon is sword and he and all his friends have ability to fly. When he wants to fly he uses his wings which are made by glass. Most of time he spends with his best friends July (only girl...she is in the right corner) and Evan (he's on the left side). July can use a shield and Evan has a bow... and he have a pet Derrall (in the city with other children) who goes anywhere with him. They are young warriors who like adventure and they are not afraid of death. Other info: Damien have brown eyes and hair, most of time he wears his red band in his hair. July have blond hair and blue eyes. She likes dresses, so changes her outfit a lot. Evan have dark brown hair and brown eyes. He have shorter hair than Damien and he have white trousers, black boots and black top of outfit. On his left hand he have a glove and on his right hand he have long sleeve (other info you can read above).

God I posted so many drawings with wings in a row LOL OOPS I decided to change his lastname to Edeus instead of Edelez; there are so many things I want to change about my manga since I started it back when I was less skilled and made lots of questionable decisions, but his lastname is actually something I can afford change so I figured I should do it now before it gets mentioned too many times HAHA... Using vibrant colours and decent amounts of contrast have always been really hard for me, so I've been trying to overcome it in my recent drawings. Not to say that high saturation is highway to success (most of the time it is) but I would like to have the ability to do this should I choose to. The latest few drawings have been my testing ground!! But I have a feeling that for future pieces that have a lot of personal importance, they'll still have the sombre tone that I use so much. I've been also spending a lot of time in my recent pieces ever since I started to really try to let go of linework in my finished drawings. I'm pretty happy about what painting without lines enables me to do, and it feels a lot better now than my previous attempts are painting many years ago. I like some of the details on this picture came out, but the summoned birds and spirits are kind of a downer because I couldn't really get them to look the way I would've liked them to look. I meant for the lighting to be very soft in the beginning with the spirits basically blending into the background that was supposed to be light, but clearly things took a drastic turn somewhere because LOL THIS IS PRETTY DRAMATIC FOR ME... and the summoned spirits became a nuisance rather than something that united the foreground with the background Keritzel is a character from my manga, carciphona.com , although he's actually immensely ordinary in the story IN OTHER NEWS I'm doing a raffle in my store for TWO Intuos Pro Mediums for the next month! check shilin.storenvy.com\/2014raffle for details ____________________________________ Read Carciphona, my original manga series!

The act of crushing the knot of tails caused the assembly of rats to come apart, and they went scurrying into the darkness. Later that night as Ruoy lay in bed stressing out over his mortgage payments, he was startled to find himself surrounded by a crowd of rats. \"All hail the Rat King!\" they squeaked in thunderous tumult. Ruoy had been made into the new Rat King after having slain the previous one in a supposed challenge to the throne. His body now houses a legion of rats, ready to come out at the first sign of easy food. Fearrr! In this picture he is going out to buy milk and is like \"Guys, I can do this. Leave me alone,\" but they are like \"No, my liege! We will accompany youuu I shall comb your hair\" Ruoy is often accompanied by his royal familiars: Wulfram and Lars Gran. They are huge weird rats that come and go at their discretion. Each familiar has a single eye that can transmit its vision to the Rat King, resulting in much headache and motion sickness for Ruoy. Ruoy's Rat King powers are kind of like a gross Dracula's in that he can disintegrate into a thousand rats and run away and then come together again and then he opens his cape and shoots three fireballs at the player. Aside from that, he can communicate with rodents and detect the presence of food. His rats will form a mantle on his back when they think it will help. But it never does. Man, this took like 2 weeks to finish, but I'm happy with it. In the sketches I was worried Ruoy was coming to look a bit too much like Soma Cruz (with the jeans, fur 'round the neck, long coat, and girly hair). But I also wanted to start drawing, so oh well. Oh yeah, Ruoy's jacket pulling is inspired by ~arnistotle's APB Sketch. On a second look, I think I goofed on the motion here; Ruoy is more just clutching his side than actually pulling on a coat. Damn! The background was the most exciting part for me, though! This picture sees a return of LINES IN THE BACKGROUND, something I haven't done since two years ago! Why did I forget this? It has value. That being said, I have mixed feelings on how the subject and the background come together in this piece. They kind of compete for attention, and it's looking busier than I would have liked. I admit I only had a vague sense of the lighting when I shaded the characters; I should probably work on the background\/environment first next time to solidify the ambiance and lighting first. Well, anyway, that was fun!

You mess with his wine, you mess with his bar, you mess with his boyfriend... Well, it was nice knowing you. Xero and Meiro from the days before they acquired the Fang and Thief.

Though the two wanted children, they were unable to conceive (something was wrong with his noodle). In their loneliness they made a dough baby and named it Komugi. But then a competitive eater arrived at the store to take on their noodle challenge, and they placed Komugi in the oven in order to get to focus on their work. Long story short, the competitive eater almost lost, but in the end he came through with an amazing turnaround that was praised in the local newspaper and was the talk of the restaurant for months to come. Nine months, even. At the end of the nine months, the udon couple were startled to hear a cry from the oven where they had forgotten their dough baby in all the excitement of TAKESHI OBAYASHI, 1998 WORLD CHAMPION PASTA-EATER. Anyhow, they opened the oven and were surprised to discover a beautiful, writhing baby girl! With a scream which started in terror and ended in delight, the couple cradled the child and then determined that she was maybe not ready yet, and put her back in for another 20-30 minutes until she was no longer sticky. Komugi was just like any other human child growing up, except that her diet consisted mainly of starches and carbohydrates, and that her arms, legs, and hair were tentacle-y noodles. These noodles would continue to grow throughout her life and would occasionally need trimming to prevent her from tripping over herself or getting tangled. The noodle grows weak and numb the farther out it grows, so there's no advantage to keeping them at longer lengths except as a whipping appendage. Trimming can be done without any discomfort as long as it's done far enough away from the root. These trimmings have been approved as food grade material, but they are surprisingly tough and rubbery and don't stop moving for quite a while. She's fairly dexterous with her noodle arms, but struggles with chopsticks, often dropping half her noodles on the floor when she eats. Her father bought her a fork to use, but being the udon daughter of an udon chef, she had very strong opinions about how udon should be eaten. She can move her hair like she does her arms and legs, but tries to keep it to a minimum in public since it frightens people. She also enjoys boiling hot baths, but if she soaks for too long, her skin becomes puffy and sensitive. Her family also has a yakisoba dog named Dogpan. He was their attempt to make a second child, but uhhh I guess this is okay too. He's a good pupper.

You can view the painting process here. emperpep.tumblr.com\/post\/69254\u2026 ====== Here's my opinion for this paper, for anyone who havent tried this watercolor paper before, but wanted to read a review before purchasing. Since I've been using Montval watercolor paper for quite a while, and I would say It's similar to Montval [They are both from Canson, But I feel like Frontenay's paper fiber is a bit more flaky, and feel harder to paint, Its surface is quite durable, even when I scrubbed it with eraser so many times. And its surface is displayed as 'Rough' on the cover but it looks like semi-rough to me. [also pretty similar to Montval which has semi-rough surface] and this paper has smooth surface on the back side. But I haven't tried using it yet. I have some more new watercolor paper blocks sitting in a shelf waiting for me to write a review for you guys, but I also need time to try them all first. so busy. ============= Tools: Sennelier L'aquarelle french artists' watercolor Holbein artists' watercolor Holbein artists' gouache ZIG brushables marker colored pencil 300g Frontenay watercolor paper ============================== Thank you to iingo and cinyu for DD suggestion and feature, I appreciate it.

There are no zombies either 3. Not even cannibals 4. I did not base the blue eyed character off of me, my friends, or you 5. Project WE is not about romance 6. It is not set in the future 7. This is not about genetic experiments that give people blue or green eyes and other powers. (Characters with same eye color might be the same person or relatives.) 8. This is not about a dispute or war between two or more families. 9. There is no disease or epidemic that's making people crazy 10. WE does not stand for World's End or World Ending. It stands for something, but I'm not gonna tell you >:3 11. This is not a series of random unrelated portraits and sketches. There's actually a story and plot behind all this. 12. It does not take place in an asylum. 13. There are no shape shifters in any way or form. That means they can't change from human to animal, person to person, or male to female and etc. If one person appears more girly in one drawing than another, then I probably screwed up while drawing 14. WE does not stand for What Ever XD If you have a question about the secret Project WE, ask and I might just answer. But they must be questions like \"is this about demons?\" or \"will there be magic?\", and not questions like \"what is this about?\" or \"What is the name of the character.\" Basically, they must be yes or no questions. I will only answer one question for every new post, and the answer will be a \"no\" like \"no, there is no demons, etc\" If I didn't choose to answer your question, that might either mean the answer is a yes, or your question didn't get picked hahaha, I'm keeping things ambiguous. So ask away and the one new answer will be revealed in the next post.

I draw anime a longer time, but I never painted drawing. I have only sketches... And guess what was the hardest thing to paint... yeap. This drops in background, on clothe...everywhere. I had to draw every single detail. It was so hard... I wanted that this looks like he is melting. Something about him: His name is Rai and when he was little he wished and dreamed that he had magic power. Everybody told him that this can't be real and that magic doesn't exist. When he was older, weird things started to happen. No one believed him and they thought that he is insane... till one day, when his dream become real. Maybe you don't know why I add this tittle \"if you believe is possible...\". If you believe in magic it is possible that it will become true (if you read description about my character you will understand). Other info: He have short brown \"fluffy\" hair and light blue eyes. He have sword and he likes to wear more fantasy costumes. He wears gloves, boots and longer jackets. He also have a small yellow earrings in both of his ears. Adobe Photoshop CS5 tablet Genius G-pen M609X...Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch Special Edititon M original size is 7100 x 4007 px I had 82 layers...with sketch I draw this 25 hours Work in progress screen shot you can see here. You can see him on this drawing too. I hope you like it and comments are welcome. EDIT: I fixed his nose and right hand... I hope that it looks better now. And I needed around 30 minutes to fix that. And I add description about my character. EDIT 2: And I edited it again... I didn't change nose but the face I made a little lighter. Because the nose isn't big... If you remember of optical illusion that white circle on black background will look bigger than black circle on white background. The same was with that nose... because the nose was lighter than the face around it looked like the nose was really big... so, the nose isn't big. EDIT 3: I edited this drawing so much... and this is the last edit (I promise). This time I made his both hands a little larger and that's all. I hope that it looks OK now. And here you can see differences between second and third edit. 2011...EDIT: Well, now I repainted whole painting. I didn't like it at all, so in September I decided to change it. I painted over .jpg file...a little with colors, then I changed it to black and white...and then I switched to colored drawing again. Here you can compare how this drawing looked before and now, after one year, when I fixed it. I changed the light on his hair, repainted his clothes, changed his face totally...ah everything. I hope it looks better now. I needed 3 hours to repaint this...

I started to draw this a long time ago, in January and I finished it in April... so that's 4 months. At first it was a landscape format, but it was always something bothering me, so I didn't draw it. Last month I decided to change the format and I saved old file as .jpg, I colored it (cuz it was b&w) and I made up new concept which you see here. I finished painting with colors, because I didn't want to look at black and white colors again. And I did it for my (renewed) Artbook cover, cuz it was only drawing which actually fit on cover. Something about them (from right to left): Damien is a good guy and sometimes he can be pretty devilish. His weapon is sword and he and all his friends have ability to fly. When he wants to fly he uses his wings which are made by glass. Most of time he spends with his best friends July (only girl) and Evan. July can use a shield and Evan has a bow... and he have a pet Derrall (behind the butterfly on the left) who goes anywhere with him. They are young warriors who like adventure and they are not afraid of death. Other info: Damien have brown eyes and hair, most of time he wears his red band in his hair. July have blond hair and blue eyes. She likes dresses, so changes her outfit a lot. Evan have dark brown hair and brown eyes (you can see WIP link to see him detailed). He have shorter hair than Damien and he have white trousers, black boots and black top of outfit. On his left hand he have a glove and on his right hand he have long sleeve (other info you can read above).

Flower is actually a flower that eventually became a girl after being bitten by a radioactive human wishing very very hard (this ability is given to all flowers; none of them ever use it, though). In her human form, Flower wanders the earth in search of humanity, which has mysteriously disappeared. All that remains are their abandoned cities and a bunch of automatons shuffling about, oblivious to their masters' whereabouts. Being a flower, Flower needs only water, sunlight, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium to stay healthy. And it also helps if someone talks to her everyday. Soothing music is good, too - she likes that. When she goes to sleep, she closes herself up and buries herself underground until daybreak. -- ART NOTES -- Alright, so remember how in my last deviation I said that Flash's line tools sucked? Apparently the Pencil tool is actually pretty decent if you use it in conjunction with the Smooth command and the Selection Tool. Also if you have a lot of time. In any case, I am very pleased with how the lineart came out, and how much cleaner it is than when I tried to work backwards. It was also very easy to color too, since all the lines made contact with each other (my traditional Brush lines would always have gaps, making it difficult to flood fill the shapes). One of these days I may consider uploading a .fla file containing the techniques used in this picture, so you curious flash artists can see what's going on under the hood. -- BONUS MATERIAL -- Alternative Background: [link] Flower in action: [link] [link] [link] Made in Flash","medium":null,"title":"Flower Girl JohnSu Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings JohnSu","url":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/art\/Flower-Girl-158058006\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"FlowerGirlJohnSuWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsJohnSuimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/723c\/th\/pre\/i\/2010\/081\/8\/1\/flower_girl_by_johnsu.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Red"],"artist":"kyo-domesticfucker","description":"Greetings, I am open to commissions, check my commissions info and if you are interested in purchasing one, send me a note, I will answer as soon as I can, thank you and enjoy my gallery: 3 New Commission InfoHello, my price list will change, the main reason is the following: I have been in DA for 5 years and the quality is better in comparison with my first commissions, therefore, it takes me longer to realize them, In spite of this I've kept the same price as possible, so, things as they are, better Quality, better price.

Towards the end of his years, he composed a series of letters between an imaginary love interest and a projection of his younger self, and then locked them away in separate cabinets. He never opened those cabinets til the day of his death, fearful that his fabricated romance would disintegrate if the letters ever came together. Ultimately the old man died and his personal possessions were cleared from the tower. The letters he wrote were discovered by the renovators and discarded in the basement furnace. As they burned, the raw emotion contained in them was released into the air and settled on a pile of old clothes nearby, animating them with the characters of the fake letters. The old man was just that pitiful that it gave the story powers to do that. Anyhow, thus were born the young man Deegan and his sweetheart Sanpi. Because the true author of the letters they were born from was the same person, the two of them shared the same heart and were drawn to each other. However, for the same reason, because there was only one heart (and perhaps because of the old poet's lingering wishes), only one of the two could exist at a time. During the day Sanpi would be the vessel for the heart, and when night came she would turn back into a pile of clothes and Deegan would take his turn as the next vessel. In this way they continued to look for each other without ever knowing what the other looked like. <\/story> Well, I hope you enjoyed some vector art and an emo story! Sorry if it's not in the same vein of humor as some of my other stuff, but I felt like writing something like this for this piece. But hey, if you're unsatisfied with the ending (or lack of ending) of this story, then here's a finisher for you! \"Deegan and Sanpi finally meet during a twilight eclipse and exchange e-mails.

I stared in this drawing for a while and when I got a little more inspiration I decided to finish it. Here I drew butterflies and butterfly wings for the first time... I just wanted to try something different. Recently I did bird wings, so I thought that it would be nice that I butterfly wings too. Hahaha... this drawing is a little more fantasy again. And I used opposite colors again, because it looks more interesting like that. This drawing I cropped few times... original size was 10674 x 7187 px, but I just didn't like composition (everything was too much straight), so I cropped it a bit. Something about them: His name (left) is Nathan and her's Scarlett. They knew each other for whole life, but when they were kids they mostly hated each other. They always did some problems... but later they both moved away and then they didn't see each other for many years. After 12 years they met again at one party. At first they didn't recognise each other. They became friends and after that they even married. They decided that this will be their new beginning. Other info: Nathan have green eyes and long blond curly hair. Scarlett also have long curly hair, only that she have a little darker hair, but still light brown color. And she have blue eyes. They both have \"elvish\" ears and butterfly wings.

Bony fingers spotted with purple grip soft, clean white sheets. The folds and crumples in the cloth almost mimicking the raised veins in her hands. Drip. Drip. Drip. Almost like clockwork. \u0093It tasted good.\u0094 With a soft sigh, the young girl\u0092s eyes flutter close, and all movement stills. Strangled cries echo in the room. Sasaki Sadako had passed away, the 644 paper cranes gathered in a bunch by her side. 356 short of a miracle. The sound of roaring wind echoes in her ears. A blinding light fills her vision as her eyelids lift. No longer in a hospital bed, no longer attached to tubes or drips, she found herself in the sky. Not quite flying but not quite falling either. In her arms were her beloved cranes, each fold carrying a hope-filled wish, unfulfilled. Freed from her suffering, freed from her pain, she realized she had no use for these any longer. \u0093You\u0092ve all worked hard. Thank you.\u0094 With outstretched arms, she bade them farewell as they stretched their wings and took to the sky. This was my contest entry for this year's Graphite, the theme being \"Flight\". This work was inspired by the story of Sasaki Sadako, the young girl who was inflicted with leukemia due to the effects of the atom bomb dropped in Hiroshima in 1945. This won 3rd Place in the contest. Hope you enjoy it!

But this time I wanted to draw something different and something which I would never draw\u2026and these are buildings. I love China's traditional architecture, so I drew that. It was really hard to draw it, because I never drew that and I didn't know where to start. Anyway\u2026it was nice to try something different. I did outlines of buildings with pen tool and brush, but I used my mouse, so sorry if it's not totally straight. His name is Kai and he is Desiree's brother. Like you probably know, she talked with crows (that's why he have a crow in his hands). Well, everyone thought that she's insane, but Kai believed her and he always protected her from people who want to hurt her. He's very protective, but he have very nice personality. Well, everyone would protect own family... Other info: He have black eyes and white hair. He mostly wears scarfs and fancy stuff on his fingers. He likes nice outfit. Adobe Photoshop CS5 tablet Genius G-pen M609X...and mouse original size is 7300 x 4886 px I had 81 layers I drew this 19 hours I explained how I used pen tool on this drawing in my tutorial How to paint digital 2.

She would much rather be a banker, though, and spend her time in a secure building doing stationary work at a safe, immobile desk. But nobody is hiring at this time. Anchovy Knights are primarily known for their speed, being very small and agile. It's like a flying motorcycle. And although the A2 is capable of producing projectiles from its exhaust, it cannot do this while in rocket mode, making it very difficult to aim and maneuver in air combat. Not a very good knight. But the rocket is pretty cute, and is popular with the children. Anchovy Knights are also sometimes called Anchovy Witches due to their uniform and the magic nature of their rockets. But not all of them are female, and don't necessarily know how to use magic. Also there are different taxes for knights, so they are registered as Anchovy Knights. Lidia here is shown as under attack by a lot of air guys. We don't know why, but at least it gave me an excuse to draw stuff hitting the grass and some funky smoke. She would probably hate me if she knew I was responsible. And if she was real. Made in Flash EDIT: A number of you have asked why she is not wearing her goggles properly.

I'm deeply happy! It's the birthday present I offered to my mother. She loved it, I'm glad. XD Now I can post it. It's really a symbolic and fantastic illustration I may say. But I had this idea in my mind for a long time, and I am glad I found the time to do it. While I think it could have turned out better, technically, I wanted to use the less external help possible. By this, I mean, draw the most things possible. Everything was made by me, except the bubble brushes and the water pattern. You can interpret it as you wish, but for those who are interested, here is the explanation: When she was a child, my mother dreamed of becoming a ballerina. And she could have been one but unfortunately she didn't. Her other dream was to help Commandant Cousteau (google if you don't know him XD) and to swim with sharks. She loves sharks. Unfortunately as well, we don't think she would be allowed, with her disease. Anyway. Being a mixed race child in a 70s french society, she has always felt different, not at her place, between two worlds which didn't fully accepted her as she was: a ballerina, a pretty girl, and a shark, a strong person. Oh and her favorite color is orange. I used all this and mixed it in this illustration: a ballerina is like a bird to me, thus why she has wings. A bird, a sea animal..sky, sea..two worlds completely different, meeting at the horizon. When she saw my present, she told me that this place, where the ballerina and the shark meet, is the place she'd like to be. I was glad. And why is the bird coming from the sea and the shark from the sky? Who knows. I did it for her, and for myself. I have no regrets if it doesn't look good or such. I'm happy. -I think the ballerina and shark want to be eachother. The shark wants to be pretty, the ballerina strong...so they imagine themselves in each other's worlds.

Look at my latest deviation with that strange looking bishie... Somebody: ............. ............. o__O Isn't that a girl?!!!!! *thought it was* LOL XD Ok. Now you know the reason why I draw mostly girls- Usada s rather skill-less at drawing boys XD'''. However I tried my best with this one. The supposed-to-be-bishie is my OC Thanatos (the same as in [link] and [link] ). Thanatos is the god of death in Greek mythology. In my own story he doesn't come each time somebody dies. In recent times his duty is to take a resistant soul who doesn't want to leave the human world. I came to free your pitiful soul from the prison of your body or something like that- these are words he says everytime he is called to take the soul with him. Thanatos is rather a quiet person but he can get annoyed very quickly. He is very ambitious and that's why he gets mad when he can't take Mizuki's soul. I dunno if there is anybody interested in my story so I 'll better stop here 8], Media used: mechanical pencil, Adobe Photoshop, Mayang textures P.S. It's my first attemp to draw a picture with such color scheme and with such a difficult pose so please forgive me all the mistakes I could made (For God's sake don't look at his hands if you don't want your eyes to burn XD ) But I still hope you'll like it #_#..

Unfortunately, the idiot that was her creator thought a microwave oven would work the same as a toaster oven, and OBVIOUSLY that would change everything. Manacchi is little more than a chicken-sized house pet now. The proud and noble beast perched atop her head is Gilligan the Hawk. He is not so proud and noble anymore, but he is trying his best. The shrimp? I'm not going to explain it. Even though Manacchi is small, that's still a huge shrimp. Not gonna explain it. Nu-uh. No. Made in Flash EDIT: The shrimp is laughing because Manacchi's mouth tickles him. And if you must know how I textured it, I dabbled it with the brush tool using 5~10% alphas, and maybe some 10~20% as well.

The theme of the book was magic and adventure, themes that seemed to fit perfectly with Ryu and the feel of his story in To the Soul. I think this is the most accurate representation of the character so far, with the slightly strange smile and the way he nonchalantly kneels in a flooded chamber to conjure memory fish from the thoughts of others. As you do. Please, if you can, take a moment to look at #Quixotic-Art-Book and learn more about this wonderful project.

The reason is that his story is split into two parts, In fang and Thief and Boys Over Faeries, which are a couple of years apart. He turns from a young scamp into a dashing one, hence the random older\/younger appearances. :3 There are a number of accompanying images to go with this.

Caroline is an artificial daughter developed by a creepy guy with a lot of time and money and no children. However, the research and construction took a long time. By the time she was completed, he had found a woman who loved him for his money and not for his looks, and she had borne him a stumpy little babyling to call his own. So! Now she is kind of like the really expensive juke box that the family likes to show off to guests. Because the technology for making artificial people is complicated shit, Caroline's head is purely decorative. Her face is painted on, and she cannot process visual stimuli. She can, however, hear what is happening around her and emulate a voice using whatever musical instruments are at hand. Speaking of which, her arms are a viola set! Caroline stores her memories as melodies, which she likes to play back on occasion to remember them. Sometimes she will also make up melodies about what it'd be like to be a rhinoceros and tip over carriages. This was a real fun one. I tried using multiple shades again like I did in Mamenoko Jack, but this time with much more vibrant colors and lighting. I was hoping to capture the feel of Capcom's arcade graphics from the 90's, but I didn't actually have any references so this was mostly from \"impressions.\" For the background, I actually referenced some Totoro art! I should do that more often - they have some beautiful trees.

They are elves and his name (right corner) is Bryce and her name (above) is Ella. They know each other since they were born and they are the best friends. They like each other, but they are afraid to make a first step... Other info: Bryce have light blue eyes and Ella have brown eyes. They both have long brown hair (Ella still have a little longer hair) and because they are elves they have ears like that. I used watercolours, black pen, technical pencil and white marker.

The priest spun around to see two more Tinnyfobs closing in. Behind him, Neith was on the ground despite the Ghost Hood he wore and Blue was snapping at the mechanical heels of another of their assailants. Munryeo could just about make out Masa's form on the crest of a small hill, fighting a small group of monsters on his own. Munryeo sighed and closed his eyes. The sun was hot on his face and his staff heavy in his hand. He had to concentrate. And, there, he could feel the warm energy building inside of him, the soft red glow creeping around his ankles. He opened his eyes and took aim, feeling the sudden pull of energy being dragged from him as he unleashed a column of mana. Crimson lightning crashed down around them, melting metal and scorching the earth. Um, AU RPG To the Soul crack, anyone? Here we have Munryeo (boy) fighting the evil Tinnyfob monsters on the Asgard Plains. The priest is far from the best mage in the world, routinely casting reflect spells on the party and then healing them with magic... You know you've done it! XD This AU RPG version of To the Soul came about when I drew a comic for the '09 Manga Jiman competition. This, however, is not to be confused with the actual RPG I am working on which is set in the real To the Soul universe. Because I cannot stop messing around with my characters and giving myself more work. Munryeo, I apologise.

He was about to suggest an otaku for a suitor when an EVIL SAMURAI rose up from the river, bellowed at them in the devil's tongue, and began chasing them across the country. What you see is day 2 of the chase, where Mikan is carrying her father because he cannot run and eat breakfast at the same time (they managed to buy a pouch of beans from a vendor while running laps around him). Oda has the idea to deter their pursuant by throwing beans at him. Mikan thinks her father is just trying to exacerbate her and his efforts are futile, while Oda is genuinely doing the best he can out of love for his daughter. EVIL SAMURAI, however, loves beans. You could ask him, \"Ingemar, what is best in life?\" and he will immediately answer \"BÃ¶nor!\" - which is presumably devil-speak for \"beans.\" This was a fun one to draw - Oda in particular feels like a Dragonball character. The other two maybe not so much like Dragonball. But fun nonetheless. I'm trying a more \"billowy\" style with clothes this time, with emphasis on more lines that bend outward. I fear the anatomy of these characters may be a bit wonky (apart from the style, of course) because this is one of those times where I just sketched the characters as they are instead of laying out their poses before hand. I'm more error-prone to this sort of thing when I skip that step, but it also lets me explore the \"feel\" of a piece more directly this way. I suppose there isn't actually anything stopping me from doing \"skeleton correction\" after the initial layout...

This angry fellow is the sky monster Ama. He hates the world, but he doesn't want to destroy it because he lives there. Anyhow, because of this he has to swallow his rage and try not to break stuff or people. But every once in a while a crow will steal his bread and that's when he snaps and has himself a crow sammich. I...don't know why this would happen more than once. Anyhow, I went back to black lines for this one just because I missed the vibrancy it gave. My last piece with the brown lines came out looking okay, but it looked very washed out so I decided I wouldn't make the change permanent. I might switch between the two in the future. On a side note, Ama's hairstyle is a first for me. This marks the first time I've made the tufts like this - I must explore this more in future pieces as well.

Unfortunately, none of the golems she makes will move on their own, so she fails to make a career of this and instead finds herself working in the mines. After almost dying on the job several times, her father urges her to pursue something safer, so she takes him up on that suggestion and becomes a bounty hunter. Her weapon of choice, Zweihander, is a set of two handed-swords which are actually just golem arms that were accidentally flattened during steaming. Those things are expensive to make, so Cailin salvaged them and worked them into swords. Even though she can't bring them to life, she has sufficient proficiency in hand-puppeteering to manipulate them like extensions of her arms. Her fighting style relies a lot on using her swords to grab and disarm her opponent when they attempt to parry her strikes. Her current opponent, Strawjack, is a renegade scarecrow that took crop protection a little too seriously and ended up running off with all the produce before the farmers could harvest them. He stockpiles them in the unfillable hole in his heart and brings them back out from his head (an ability called \"Face Plant\"). Also, he's a shameless flirt who preys on fresh fruits & vegetables. --- This time I made only the line art and flat colors in Flash, and then did everything else in Manga Studio. I finally learned to make use of selections by using the magic wand tool on the flats, and so was able to do all the character lighting on two layers. I tried for sharper shadows than I usually do in digital painting, and I think I like it! I believe I've made a mistake in the past where I felt that I had to shade smoothly when not in Flash (since it's hard to make soft shadows there), but I feel like the harder, flatter shading produces a stronger visual impact. I also had fun with the background - I find nature to be more fun to paint than buildings since it's a lot more forgiving in regards to shapes and perspective. You can easily tell when two boxes don't line up, but if a tree is crooked...that's OK. Oh yeah, and yes, Cailin does have a clock as her belt buckle because I didn't know what to do for its design and ended up just basing it off of a wrist watch. Because giant hands.

Since we both worked on it, this same picture will also pop up in her gallery, if you're watching her, please support her too! For each couple pictured above, I drew the left character, and she drew the ones on the right. Can you see the differences? These are also done in the orders we'll be telling the stories: Sam&Sara > Jay&Jess > Stella&Gale > Mona&Su-Mi Also the two sets of couples on the left are the high school couples, and the right two are the college couples (though one of them isn't in college, the bum) Again, Picture This is a collection of short love stories between GIRLS, so there are no boys in the picture (though Jay is PRETTY DAMN CLOSE LOL) ---- Picture this...

I drew this with my new technique and I used million of different brushes...again. I drew everything pretty much different than my other drawings...the big difference you can see that I didn't draw hair the same at all, and another one is that I didn't used outlines and line-arts. So it looks more soft like that... I know that Iviernu's character Alessandro doesn't have wings...but I added them just because of symbolism... you can understand that, like that Alessandro is an angel and he made her dreams and wishes come true...or that he \"killed\" her, and he is an \"angel\" who'll take her to the Heaven (read the story below, so you'll understand). And here is a little story about them : They love each other, but more like a family than a lover. Their job is basically giving 'dreams' to human (although the result is questionable), but ironically, Lotus herself can't achieve what she really wants. Her dream is to be free from her job, something that's close to impossible. And because Alessandro loves her, he decided to use his power to make her go into a deep sleep, so that she'll be freed from her duty. Even if it was only happen in a dream. So yes, in a way, you could say he killed her (story written by Iviernu).

This one is of another of his characters, Tsubi Aisley. I'll let ~HitomiBoy explain: ---------- Tsubi Aisley Tsubi is the human incarnation of the angel Mae Adeline, even though she doesn't know it. She is 2% avian and 98% human, which gives her the vestigial and otherwise useless wings on her back. She comes from a well off family and is highly intelligent and creative, though only wishes to live life to the fullest, not really work her butt off, thus why she took up guitar, and fled her parent's home. Tsubi Aisley and Mae Adeline (c) HitomiBoy ---------- The overall setup was chosen by ~HitomiBoy, but I got to design pretty much everything. I was also to make her 'well endowed', not that it's anything unusual in my gallery. xP It wasn't mentioned in the description above, but she's in a band called Hunger Crisis, which the poster on the wall is about. The guitar is not based on any specific design, but is more of a weird combination I came up with. I don't really know a thing about guitars though, so excuse any silly details about it or the way she's handling it or whatever. The guitar is hooked to an amp (another original design) on the right. I'm sure ~HitomiBoy will be checking on the comments here, so if you have any questions about the character, I'm sure you can leave 'em here too for him to reply.

XD More Krovaski and Sadie Baber were lovers. For them, it was love at first sight. More was the almighty Lord of Dragons, and Sadie was...well, an average little girl who shared perhaps many many other girls' dreams. She has no idea why he chose her, but he did, and the two was so happy together until others started to get jealous of her, and that's when things were turned... More, a man perfect in almost every way, be it strength, power, looks...failed Sadie in the face of false facts and rumors. Just when the girl thought she could be the happiest girl on the planet, he abandoned her because he thought she was impure, a cheater, a whore...things that Saide could never imagine of being. Feeling betrayed and heartbroken beyond words and tears, the helpless mermaid chose death in order to prove her innocence. By the time More realized what truly happened, Sadie was already gone. The only thing she had left for him was a promise that she'd always love him, and her cold, lifeless yet nonetheless beautiful body. It was not enough for him. He had realized this a long time ago, about how much he loved her, and how much he had regretted of letting her go. But now, it was too late...the Lord of Dragons shed tear of blood for the loss of the one he loved the most, in midst of it, an overwhelming feeling of regret, guilt, and a sin that could never be repaid. As a punishment, More laid a curse upon himself and Sadie. That they will always reincarnate together, that he'll always love her, and that she will always hate him until the day she truly forgives him... And thus began their story, across time and through countless reincarnations. The scene depicted here is the moment where More laid a curse upon himself, sealing Sadie's body along with him in ice of eternity so the two can be reincarnated together. Do excuse the long-winded background story. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For 's art contest. :9 Thanks to *CITRUSLOVE I was able to find it first of all...XD Gives me an excuse to draw my OCs. Since the theme required me to draw my OCs in a grand setting and all God like etc etc, these two are the first to come to my mind. For those of you who know me well, these two OCs should be veeeerrrrrry familiar for you. (and for those who recently visited my DA from =sakimichan 's \"trapped within\" commision, the guy in the pic is the same guy that saki did, only in a different form. : D ) I'll be nice to you guys and stop rambling about these two. They are like, my babies ;w; (especially More, of course. *w* ). Thank you *shilin for holding this wonderful contest. It gave me an excuse to get away from commisions and do something I love once in a while. <333 Oh yeah, and FULL VIEW PLZ. thanks. :3","medium":null,"title":"Curse of Eternity tooaya Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings tooaya","url":"https:\/\/tooaya.deviantart.com\/art\/Curse-of-Eternity-83089938\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"CurseofEternitytooayaWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingstooayaimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/tooaya.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/f6df\/th\/pre\/f\/2008\/108\/e\/c\/curse_of_eternity_by_tooaya.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"Delurianne","description":"Little Miss... Sat on a... Eating... ...a spider Again this is for and, in case you didn't recognize her... this is his character, MIKA! This time I drew her. MY LINEART AND MY COLORING yes... She looks dead and demented... like most of the lolitas I've rendered. Apparently, I really like them that way. So if you want your cute lovely lolitas to look like they recently swallowed poison (or an arachnid, in this case) you know who to approach. Well, the story behind this is... I just wanted to make a rendition of Mika in a \"Little Miss Muffet\" scene... but I got goosebumps when I drew the spider... I'm not fond of bugs (although spiders are nicer than other crawlies) so I made her EAT the spider. It actually made me feel very good about this drawing. This didn't come out the way I wanted... but in the end I like it anyway. You may ask why I put this in traditional. Let me explain once and for all that I base my sectioning on HOW\/WHEN I DO THE SHADING... If I shaded it in ink\/pencil, I put it in traditional, if I do the shading in Photoshop, I put it in digital. and FYI: my fave blur tool is the anistropic grain filter. Black Ink and Photoshop7.

Anyhow, here's my rendition of how a half-fish half-woman creature ought to appear. Pale, pasty skin, flat yellow eyes, sharp teeth, gills, and the inability to survive out of water. Hawt. This piece was pretty fun to color. The sand is made of a radial gradient with three white gradients on top to make mounds. Similarly, the water was made from a murky-blue-transparent gradient, which reminds me: for beginner artists, remember that shallow water is clear. These waves turned out to be the funnest to draw for me, though I still need to refine the technique. Man, water is so exciting.

If you have followed my page or my social media, it\u2019ll no secret that i greatly dislike the rework 2017 of Evelynn, a character i\u2019ve been playing as main since the release of League of legends. I\u2019ve done my own interpretation of what i would do for a rework. Of course, if this was a design for an actual game, it would go through brainstorming and revisions, but this is the direction i would like to take her. I would make her spikes to be actually part of her as some kind of carapace, justifying in a way the pinky colors, and also doing the heels as part of her body. The lines of cloth she usually had in her arms, now would be on her back as part of her, and would be used in the same way as Lucy from Elfen lied. Now, mechanically speaking, it would be a little more complicated. Evelynn has never been a strong character; her \u201Cproblem\u201D was that she had \u201Canti-fun\u201D mechanics, meaning that her kit made fun to play WITH her, but not AGAINST her. Been attacked by surprise is one of the most disliked things by players of every game on existance. FPS players hate snipers, and players from MMOs like Lineage 2 hate archers and assassins, etc. The reason is that when you\u2019re killed by surprise you\u2019re left totally unsatisfied, since you did nothing to fight against the one who killed you, and that makes you think the character must be op. In truth, characters like Eve or Lineage 2 phantom rangers need to be played carefully to get the surprise and finish the enemy fast, since they would be annihilated in a \u201Cfair\u201D fight. But most people in this games are the kind who play easy champions like Yi, Yasuo, Xin zao, etc, who just jump at you and mash all buttons without worring about moving. Those players will always consider unfair that someone can kill them by surprise, even if it\u2019s because they were alone, far from any help, with an adc, in a game with a fed Evelynn. So for as long as Evelynn has stealth mechanics, she\u2019ll always be \u201Canti-fun\u201D, players will always complain and will be very hard to fix. If it was me, i would change her in a way that would make me (as a company) and pro players very sure that she\u2019s not op and then ignore all of the low players. Personally, i would bring back old Eve; and i mean OLD Eve, the one with complete invisibility. I would make her W be invisibility, but with a long cooldown after becoming visible (and bringing back vision potions); i would keep her old Q, since her spammy Q has always been one of the characteristics of her mechanic, unlike the bullshit they\u2019ve done now. But i would make some tweaks. I would drop the Q damage by a lot, and then for the E, i would make it a nuke (no speed or attack speed or anything) that marks the enemy and lowers their defences. The mark would increase the damage of Q by a lot, but the E would have a very high cooldown. For ultimate i would introduce a kind of \u201CSyndra\u201D ulti, where Eve throws her cloths at an enemy for a number equal to the Qs that have landed that enemy. This would mean that Eve could go invisible, position herself, mark the weakest or most dangerous enemy, nuke it, and then become totally useless until she has W and E again (thus the long cooldowns on both). Also she would be very hard to use if the enemy buys vision potions. This would be a way for her to finally fullfil her role as assassin, mantain her theme, her mechanic, and not be op. Of course this is just something i came up thinking about it a little, but still it\u2019s better than the shit they\u2019ve done now.

What now? She was out of food completely. And it was far too late for delivery now... even an angel had her limits on Earth. Did she need to sleep? Not particularly. Did she need to visit the ladies room? Angels didn't produce waste, everything was converted into either energy or stores to fuel her holy magics. But time... she had no control over time. Not only time, but her funds provided for her test were starting to run low... and she hadn't even done anything to prove herself yet. In fact, her wings had shrunk even more since being booted out of the Pearly Gates. Well... she did have one option. With great difficulty, Angela swung herself off her bed, an act that became a tad more grunt filled every day. Taking a deep breath, Angela began the long waddle from her bed all the way to her dresser, bulging belly swinging, full, plump and unrestrained down over her thighs. With nothing holding it up, at the rate she was growing, it would cover her knees soon. Angela bit her lip at the thought, conflicted. Maybe she had gone to far with this compulsive need to feel her belly filled to burst, was she really willing to risk her angelic position and figure for pleasure? On the other hand, the idea of eating until her belly grew big enough to cover her legs, stacked high with blubber and filled with creamy goodness... it kinda excited her. Without thinking, her hands gradually moved towards her backside and began to squeeze her swollen bottom. This was without a doubt her favorite part of her new weight. So large and soft, always plush unlike her constantly stuffed belly and it was so much larger than her breasts. Heck, it was larger than any part of her body. Perfect for lazing around on a personal cushion. Lost in her self fondling, she didn't realize when she had reached her dresser until her belly pressed against the hard wood. Angela snapped out of her fantasies and looked down at the one possession (other than the clothes on her back...) she'd been allowed to bring from Heaven. A small silver card, thick and glittering in the lamplight of her room. Written in gold, it clearly read: \u201CGood for 1 Free Small Miracle (offer does not stack with other deals. Only redeemable before Rapture. One per visit)\u201D Plucking it with plump fingers, Angela stared at the card. She was given this to help along with her test. It was only a small miracle. Enchanting an item with holy power... creating a building from sand.... curing a sick man... all possible options. But, there was no limit on what the miracle could be. She was free to choose her path... even if it was the 'wrong' one. While her belly was far from grumbling, she certainly felt like it should be, as her need to fill it up grew. She could still turn this trip around though... she could go back home. She just needed to shape up. This card held her future. Would she use it to further spiral down the path of unashamed gluttony? Or would she return on white wings, free of vice? - Angela shoved another chunk of cake into her mouth, ignoring the slice she was already chewing. If it could fit, she shoved it in her fat cheeks. While they used to be puffed up purely on food, her cheeks were now permanently plumped and pudgy, her face finally starting to fatten up with the rest of her swollen body. Crumbs and frosting surrounded her lips constantly... not that she left them. After every treat she went to work making sure to gobble up every last morsel. Still, her frantic scarfing left her having to repeat this grooming process regularly. She was glad her lavender hair was so short enough to avoid getting dirty, it saved her the time of having to clean it. As far as she was concerned, there were no regrets on her use of the Miracle. Since using it, she hadn't had to get up even once, sitting down and getting comfy on the cushion her own butt provided. Everything she needed was in front of her at all times. Enchanting her fridge to always stock itself full of sweets- genius. Of course, it would only work for her, but that restriction was a plus in her mind. Not like she planned on giving any of her bounty to another soul. No, every cake, pie, pudding, and cookie was hers and hers alone, and they would all find their way into her ever growing supple belly. And with how things were going, there was no way she could change her position anymore anyway. Angela's past few weeks were full of constant stuffing and relaxation. A constant cycle of eating until her belly was red and about to pop, and laying back in ecstasy, near the point of drooling in pleasure until she processed enough to fill herself up again. And there was no doubt that she had packed on the pounds. Her fantasy from a few weeks back and been met and surpassed. Her rolling gut flowed between her luscious lard packed pillars of legs, and over past her knees. Filled with food every waking moment, it retained a full round shape, even in it's immense size which was inching towards her jiggly cankles at an alarming rate. Her breasts acted like the cherry on top of her vanilla sundae of a gut. They had to be the least affected part of her binging, but there was no doubt they still grew, forcing her old dress to act as sort of a 'half bra' barely keeping her decency in her home... not that she cared if it came off. But at the moment, it was keeping her a bit warm while sitting in front of the fridge, so there was no point in taking it off. Besides, if anything missed her mouth, it would fall between her quivering boobs, and as long as her dress could catch it, she could reach in and pop it back where it belonged. But the hero of her body was most definitely her bottom. While it was always the largest part of her body, it had absolutely blossomed into its full quaking glory. Each of her cheeks exceeding the size of a large exercise ball, calling her bottom a shelf was an understatement. Honestly calling her ass a 'couch' was much more accurate than a shelf. Three full grown men could sit on her delightful cushions and not feel crowded. Of course, she wasn't going to share. This was her's. She'd worked hard to make her delicious bottom so luscious, and she planned to take advantage of it in its full glory as often as possible- when she was full at least. Not that that was easy to accomplish. But she relished the opportunity to lay back into her own bottom and massage it. Though her growing arms proved to make that more difficult as their own size made reaching back, or at any other than straight out for that matter, almost painful. So, obviously, she had to make her own butt bigger and bigger so that she could reach it with less effort. A viscous cycle indeed, but it was going to happen eventually anyway. Her striped underwear had proven to be much more resilient than she had given them credit for, as they were still stretching to accommodate her gigantic fertile globes. It was one of her many goals to have them pop off on their own. With the way they were digging into her fluffy buttocks, an inch deep crease at least, it was only a matter of time until she had to set a new one. And so, her favorite body part was decided. While her belly provided the pleasure, her ass and hips were becoming a perfect resting place for her arms after an hour of stuffing her face. The softness of hundreds of pounds of plush cottony fat mixed with her own, smooth perfect alabaster skin make for a wonderful sensation combination. And with her arms beginning to become harder and harder to move as they plumped up and rounded out (her forearms had already hidden her wrist in a fold of fat), she found herself having to take a break in her stuffing more often than she would have liked. Grabbing plush handfuls of her juicy bottom, succulent breasts, or fluffy belly and fondling them, spanking them, and generally just feeling herself jiggle and bounce was almost causing her as much happiness as eating did. Even with no way to reach her more tender of areas anymore, she still found herself able to relieve herself through the mixture of stuffing and fondling. And she took every chance she had to experience it. Not like there was much else to do. Although, being able to sit back into her own fat and sink down to relax was nice at times, there was so much more fun she could have. A moment where her hands were free and not tired was a moment were that delicious Boston Creme Pie could be sliding down her gullet into a needy tummy. The chocolate crÃ¨me puffs were already being scarfed down though, one in each hand. Taking a large chunk out of a fresh one, the rich sweet pudding spurted out messily. Some of the sugary goodness leaked out of her overstuffed mouth, and trickled down the corner over her face, over her plump ever shrinking neck, and drew to a halt at the crease of her heaving breasts. Now she was back into the rabid feeding part of her cycle once more. A pre-sliced caked became her next target, easy for her crumb covered hands to grab between their bloated fingers. For a while it seemed like she was going to even lose the ability to grab the food in front of her face, as her arms began to lose more and more of their mobility. But her fears were quelled... somehow. It seemed she was just able to grab the treats she desired when she desired it. Almost like magic. Certainly nothing to complain about. Though she couldn't reach the full expanse of her belly, leaving the remainder of the cake and grabbing a bowl of Turtle Pudding and shoveling it into her greedy maw was easy as could be. Then the thick vanilla malt with the wide straw. Then the perfectly molded strawberry Jell-o. Almost nothing could stop Angela's stuffing spree (save for the Jell-O, which she admitted to gleefully starting and and shaking for a while, reminded of her own plump rump.), her belly stretched out and calling for even more than last time. A small prod into the her fatty back, caused Angela to stop halfway through another slice of the cake. Was someone there? Who dare interrupt her Angela time? Turning, she gazed back towards her own soft ass and searched for her poker... but no one was in the room. Instead, from the base of her back sprouting up from the top of her jiggling cheek spheres, a plump curly tail wiggled around happily, in the rhythm of Angela's chewing. 'Strange' Angela thought turning back to more important matters. 'I don't remember having a tail.' She was slightly disappointed actually. Part of her was hoping it was her own bottom touching her back. Well, that meant going back to work. Now she had another goal to work for. Looking into the fridge, she eyed out her next victim as she shoved the rest of the slice in her mouth. 'But I do remember this peanut butter fudge. Yummy.' ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Another story to accompany another commission for This one was actually done for a while, but \"circumstances\" kept me from uploading it immediately. It was done as a follow-up to this pic: In which, Angela gives up being an angel in favor of staying on earth and eating ALL THE SWEETS.

He lives in his office at his station, with his bed situated just above his desk. His mom makes fun of him, but he is grateful that she still sends him food even though he is 30. The thing he is holding in this picture is his Horse. It has zero horsepower. Its main function is to reduce travel friction by floating off the ground while the driver and passengers push along with their legs. So yes, it is essentially a hoverboard in the form of a stick horse. It hovers passively by some sort of magical imagination, and originally belonged to a friend who used to cart ice cream around town with it. In order to attract customers, the horse head plays musical tunes while it moves. This makes law enforcement a little awkward. I had not drawn a dude for a while, and I had not drawn a Western pic for even longer (my memory tell me it has been approximately never), so Lawrence here meets both quotas. Designing him was kind of fun, and at the same time a challenge. I struggled a bit with his hair. Originally his bangs were longer, but I felt it was a bit too...cheap. I said to myself, \"Don't be such a thoughtless artist, relying on some sort of formula that says Long Hair = Cool.\" So I cut his bangs a little shorter and gave him a ponytail. Oh I am genus. His poncho combines with his sideburns to make him moar manly. Also, it is inspired by a little girl's poncho. He also has no hat. My brother says that kind of defeats the whole purpose of a Western, and I guess he's kind of right. But I don't like how a hat looks on him, so I am going to say that all he can find are lady hats. Made in Flash EDIT: I'm going to answer a couple of the more frequently asked questions here: 1) Why not put a hat on a string around his neck? - I'm not going to give him a hat if I don't like how it'll look on him, even if he's not wearing it at the moment. 2) Why does he have spurs on his gloves? - So he can put his elbows on the ground and use them like tiny wheels. 3) I like his zipper - That is his officer's tag. And his shirt uses Velcro. 4) What are those things in the background? - Those are ice cream base stations. Ice cream is pivotal to the West's economy. - Or they might be clouds, depending on what you're talking about.","medium":null,"title":"Western Brave JohnSu Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings JohnSu","url":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/art\/Western-Brave-119313170\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"WesternBraveJohnSuWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsJohnSuimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/d2b4\/th\/pre\/f\/2009\/104\/0\/8\/western_brave_by_johnsu.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"ichitakaseto","description":"my contest entry for extravaganza 2010, the theme is flight, and I chose steampunk since thats something i havent done before, and it was fun doing it too. It sets in a world of steampunk utopia, where mankind has taken the technology to a level that is so advanced, they are even able to elevate the whole city. So apart from flying vehicles such as hot air balloons and airships, this kind of steam powered flying suite is an essential tool for travelling from places to places. Its design is complex yet elegant. It's equiped with two powerful steam powered turbine engines that sit on the tip of the wings. A pressure meter is equiped on the left arm to allow the pilot to constantly moniter the pressure level and fuel status, while three pressure vavles sit on the other arm giving the pilot delicate control over the thrust on both engines and the rotation of the wings for turning. The wings are locked into place on a shoulder piece that rests on the pilot's shoulder. To minimise the stress on the pilot;s shoulder, the should piece is supported by two hydualic levers that is connected on the other end to a metal ring around the waist, the metal ring is again connected to the suit through 10 mini hydualic levers so that the weight of the whole shoulder piece and the engines can be dispersed to the whole body leaving the pilot with little stress on the shoulders. So it makes the suit comfortable to wear under any situations. thanks for viewing. =v=","medium":null,"title":"extravaganza 2010 FLIGHT ichitakaseto Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings ichitakaseto","url":"https:\/\/ichitakaseto.deviantart.com\/art\/extravaganza-2010-FLIGHT-185211863\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"extravaganza2010FLIGHTichitakasetoWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsichitakasetoimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/ichitakaseto.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/0556\/th\/pre\/i\/2010\/320\/6\/4\/extravaganza_2010_flight_by_ichitakaseto-d329qdz.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"Thecoldtrojan","description":"Gabriel from Gabriel Dropout Drawn by me, supported by patrons like you!

What follows is a series of clandestine events that unite a princess, a knight and a sorcerer to solve their King's mysterious demise\u0085 Princess Goes underground after her father, the King of Cordonne is murdered. The brooch she wears in her hair was a gift from the Monarch of Abyssinia 10 years ago, in an inter-kingdom banquet for the Pact of Peace between Abyssinia and Cordonne. She refuses to let it go, this symbol of a life she once had and a peace her father had once believed achievable. Armed with the Cusp of Monarchs, the sacred sword of the Cordonne Royal Bloodline, she seeks to unravel the mystery of her father's death. Knight Served in the Battle of Kazkhan as an Armada Commandant of Cordonne's Elite Unit. Three years into the Battle of Kazkhan, the Knight is severely wounded. Disillusioned with the War, the Knight turns to skypiracy for several years. During the closing year of the Battle of Kazkhan, the King of Cordonne pleads for the Knight to return to the kingdom, this time as the blossoming Princess' retainer and mentor. When the King was murdered, the Knight immediately took the Princess underground, fearing that she would be the killer's next target. Sorcerer One-time Royal Adviser and long-time friend of the King of Cordonne, the Sorcerer was vehemently against the war between Abyssinia and Cordonne. His stand against the war cost him not only his position as Royal Adviser, but also strained his friendship with the King. Speculators say that the Sorcerer was against the war because the battleground was his homeland of Kazkhan; but the Sorcerer maintains that the conflict might have been averted had the King practiced lenient diplomacy. Now, the day after the King is murdered, the King's daughter stands on his doorstep, asking for his help to exact vengeance.

Kawaisouna Mahoushoujo Monogatari (Ebifly! Sad Magical Girl Story) Eri Mizutani, an average highschooler, was one day buying fish for her mother when she slipped on a discarded head of tuna and knocked over a tank of shrimp, releasing them into the nutrient-laden gutters. After paying for the damages, she was walking back home when lo! a voice came at her from the sewers below. Among the fortunate shrimp she saved was a magical prawn (which is not a shrimp, but nobody really cares except marine-biologists) who shows his gratitude by granting Eri the ability to transform into the heroine Ebifly, along with one super power of her choice. Seeing herself in the reflection of a local pigeon's eyes, she says, \"I hope nobody recognizes me.\" And so, the unrecognizeable heroine is born! She can magically switch to her alter-ego at whim without anyone suspecting who she is. Even when appearing to the same person twice as Ebifly, they will deny ever having met her before. With this practically useless power, Ebifly has no enemies and no trouble trying to protect her secret identity, though nobody would really care anyway. Her shrimp powers include swimming, breathing underwater, and the ability to feed on plankton. These are all useless as she lives many miles inland. As Ebifly, Eri walks around the neighborhood and...helps the children with normal stuff like getting their dogs to come out from under park benches. That kind of stuff. Not that anybody cares. Well anyhow, on to the story behind creating the character! I was eating shrimp for dinner one day and was peeling the shell off of them like a jacket. Then I wondered what it'd be like to dress in a shrimp's shell. The end. The name \"Ebifly\" is a pun on \"Ebi-furai\" - fried shrimp. However, she doesn't fly, and isn't a fly. I just didn't bother to think that far ahead (that is, three letters) when I chose the name. My excuse now will be that shrimps look like they're trying to fly when they swim. There. On another note, I came across an observation while designing this character: Can you name one creature that has more than four legs and isn't a bug? Or at least doesn't look like one? I asked my mom this and after a while she answered \"dragon.\"","medium":null,"title":"Ebifly JohnSu Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings JohnSu","url":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/art\/Ebifly-37246561\/?purchase=print&itemids=83","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"EbiflyJohnSuWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsJohnSuimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/fe30\/i\/2006\/213\/5\/6\/ebifly_by_johnsu.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"cwutieangel","description":"Kiriban for Took a VERY LONG TIME to finish just due to life in general, but FINALY DONE.

It's one of my favorite japanese tales so i decide draw the main character of the draw based on the lovely crane of the tail. I thougt that she must have black long hair, withe feathers on the hair and a withe kimono with cents of sakura flowers^^ She must be beutifull and lovely I thought and i start to draw her. The contest was about a manga and anime event here in Spain, so i draw her reading an old manga where characters come to live form it. This manag characters had been drawed trying to give a general idea about all the kind of themes that you can find in a manga: Kendo, school girls, fairy and magic tails, and tails about ordinary and extraordinary live. Also for the back ground i tryed to make something like Mucha's background from the art nouveau but with sakura floyers. Thats is because i want to mix the occidental culture with the japanise culture. And more or less this is the explain of this draw. Just hope you like it! ------------------------------------------------------ Esta IlustraciÃ³n corresponde al ultimo concurso al que me he presentado. Llevaba mucho tiempo escondiÃ©ndolo, pero ahora mismo ya puedo enseÃ±arlo. Esta basado en uno de mis cuentos Japoneses favoritos: \"La grulla agradecida\". La verdad es que la explicaciÃ³n en ingles me ha quedado bastante casposa ya que no se exactamente como decir lo que realmente quiero y bueno... No quiero recurrir a los traductores del infierno.... La idea era mezclar el mundo occidental con el Japones, es por eso por lo que a pesar del aspecto del dibujo he querido meterle un pequeÃ±o toque europeo con el fondo. Se trata de una imitaciÃ³n de Mucha, un ilustrador del \"art nouveu\" aderezado con un pequeÃ±o toque japones, las flores del cerezo en vez de los clasicos lirios y camelias que el usaba para sus carteles. Respecto al personaje principal, querÃ­a que diera el aspecto de una hermosa \"princesa grulla\", por eso sus largos cabellos negros, las plumas que adornan su pelo, su inmaculada piel blanca y un hermoso kimono blanco con cientos dde delicadas flores del cerezo destacan sobre el resto de la imagen centrando toda la atenciÃ³n en sus ojos rosados que miran timidamente a los nuestors al ser sorprendida leyendo un manga. Este manga es bastante especial, pues no es un maga ordinario, de el, sus personajes vuelven a la vida y salen de sus aletargadas paginas que son leÃ­das con cariÃ±o por la princesita. TambiÃ©n he querido representar con los personajes la temÃ¡tica mas amable y tradicional del manga: el kendo, las historias del dÃ­a a dÃ­a, la fantasÃ­a, y las escenas que de normales pueden pasar a extraordinarias. No se, ya solo me queda esperar que os guste, pues en este trabajo he invertido muchas horas de esfuerzo y aprendizaje^^","medium":null,"title":"Sakura Hime Kenneos Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings","url":"https:\/\/kenneos.deviantart.com\/art\/Sakura-Hime-180270218\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"SakuraHimeKenneosWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/kenneos.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/fdb6\/i\/2010\/266\/f\/5\/sakura_hime_by_kenneos-d2zbte2.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," White"],"artist":"gigiEDT","description":"Yeah, I love this character.

I dunno this started off as more of a simple scribbly with shading practices... before I became attached enough to keep working into it until it's what it is now. Since there was originally not much intentions towards finishing it until midway into the process I just ran into trouble after trouble of ideas and work that didn't really match with one another. Anyway...lesson learned...sort of. Maera Caenis Aria (Not Nereus anymore. In story reboot their surnames changed) is a halfling mermaid and the current generation pirate king of Arvinia (The Rogue Tide Maiandros) as well as an illegitimate princess to the Water Country of Renlovi- though it was a secret her mother kept rather tightly. Much of her childhood was spent in Vorsha, the country of dragon descents due to her mermaid mother's relatively short-lived paranoia towards the sea, and came to be long term friends with the now King of Vorsha, a dragon hybrid by the name of Kessalendros to whom she builds strong yet unresolved feelings towards due to a series of very complicated personal\/commitment issues that keep her from romantically chasing him. Her adolescent years were spent coming and going on adventures- even at some point with the pirate Zendro. Now she's just busy running from her half brother, building her legendary ship, searching for the Wind God, all the while gathering information on a mysterious person by the name of Ebon whose appearance always seems to brew trouble- the kind of trouble she doesn't want befalling on her dragon king. Kessalendros isn't mine, but I take full responsibility for his abs. Yes I do. ___________________________________________________ More Taming the Demon art at:Taming the Demon Gallery","medium":null,"title":"Ttd: Dragon and Fish ippus Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings ippus","url":"https:\/\/ippus.deviantart.com\/art\/Ttd-Dragon-and-Fish-289242432\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"TtdDragonandFishippusWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsippusimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/ippus.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/9888\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/133\/6\/3\/ttd__dragon_and_fish_by_ippus-d4s7gw0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"Karbo","description":"A view of the Chordoni waterfalls and its surroundings ( [link] ).

She likes to hide out in the stratosphere, where she can listen to radio signals from around the world and enjoy a wide variety of music and sometimes encrypted military transmissions. Her hair acts as both a ballast (or would this be an anti-ballast?) and antennae, allowing her to maintain her elevation and pick up electromagnetic waves. On occasion she will be attacked by a delirious bird and she will wrassle it. This is always exciting for her. One time she fought a baby goose. --- So I\u2019m finally back to drawing regular pictures! I thought I\u2019d kick this off with a piece done entirely in Flash since I haven\u2019t done that for a \u201Cnice\u201D picture in quite a while. The smooth flat cel shading is refreshing to return to! But the background feels a little lacking, so I think I may return to painted backgrounds in the future when it seems appropriate. Empy might look like she is ready to kill you, but don\u2019t worry. Worrying will only alert her to your weakness. Also, I don\u2019t know why I did this, but only one of her arms is in her jacket sleeve. I will say it is because that arm is warmer than the other.

Normally \"Otoshimono\" means an object that was dropped and lost, but I've used the kanji for \"person\" in place of \"object,\" so here it means something complicated and ambiguous at best. That's what I get for experimenting. But not to worry - localization will most likely resolve this in an accurate and appropriate manner, like they always do. Character: Anyhow, the nameless old man (whom I shall call the Otoshimono) in this picture wanders endlessly through a Nevermorning <strike>Wood<\/strike> Forest in search of things or people so that he can eat them. It is in your best interest to find your lost possessions (or be found) before the Otoshimono does. He's nearly blind, which helps, but his lantern is able to guide him towards the lost, so that kind of sucks for you. EDIT: If ever he meets you, he will ask if you are lost. If you answer \"Yes,\" he will promptly eat you. If you answer \"No,\" he will leave and you'll be left in the dark and possibly starve to death. The correct answer is to say \"No - I have lost my Way and am looking for it. Have you seen it?\" to which he will answer no, but will be then be intrigued. He will then shamble off in search of it so he can eat it before you. Fortunately, he is unaware that he cannot eat intangible concepts, so if you follow behind him, he will unwittingly lead you out. Clever clever. Artist's Comments: It's been a long time since I drew and submitted anything, and the first time since getting a new laptop, so I'm glad to do so. I'd probably have much rather enjoyed drawing a gurl instead, but at the same time I don't want my gallery to become chock-full of repetitive material. I don't want to give a critic grounds to say \"All he draws are young pretty girls,\" but rather \"John Su draws young pretty girls, but also on occasion a hideous old man. He appears to have no direction and is confused as to what he is trying to accomplish, and might as well be taking shots in the dark. I will vote for John Su for president.\" On a more relevant note, I think I got sloppy. Staff needs more texture in its shading.

When I thought of what I wanted, I didn\u0092t like how I had the Eevee drawn, it was in its old generic position that was made on the card back in the day and I wanted something more cute and playful, so I drew this. I love this picture. I put a lot of hard work into it for three days and I just enjoy staring at it. My favorite is the sun and moon, that I made out of crystal though you can\u0092t see them well because of Eevee, but the Waterstone is a close third, because I love the bubbles so much. I know Eevee doesn\u0092t evolve using the Sunstone, and\/or moon\/dusk stone. I was actually in the middle of drawing this when I decided that instead of a regular sun and moon, to represent night and day in the background, I was going to make them crystal as well, then I thought it would be even cooler to have the sun be the actual sun stone, and the moon to be crystal in the same colors as the duskstone.

Having no muscles, he moves by means of a complex network of twine that originates from a ball in his chest cavity and connects to his joints. The jack on his belt is mainly ornamental but doubles as a compass, but he never uses it because he doesn't get lost (and the damn thing doesn't tell you which end is pointing where). The wings on his back are also ornamental; he can jump, be he can't fly. And though his boots have eyes and teeth, they are not alive - he merely borrowed the body parts from local carcasses. Yeah, he plans to return them. Tomorrow. He'll do it tomorrow. My original design of Hollow included an ugly hat and no \"wings,\" and he was a bit more like a scarecrow and had exposed bones for forearms. I eventually ditched the stupid hat and drew on the wings after I tried a scarf and it failed.

And I drew on my sketch again, because I didn't like to draw everything from the beginning. It's easier like that. I blurred background a little, because I thought that it would look better and drawing would have more depth, it looks more realistic like that. Adobe Photoshop CS5 tablet Genius G-pen M609X original size is 5506 x 7100 px I had 93 layers I drew this 17 hours I explained how I drew tree on this drawing and how I colored B&W drawing in my tutorial How to paint digital 2 Details you can find here. Work in progress screen shot you can find here Sketch you can see here Here you can see web comic of her. I hope you like it and comments are welcome.

My dA feels really inactive lately because I noticed i've been posting a lot of doodles and sketches on my twitter feed lately. Also the last month I spent some time living with a friend to get away from my regular flow so I was only able to get a few drawings\/illustrations out during that time. I also just hit 1000 followers on tumblr and 50,000 pageviews on deviantART so I plan on doing something for both occasions assuming I don't end up forgetting. However, the chances that I might end up being too busy to do anything at all is a high chance as well because of all these games that have been released this month. Just as a headsup, I will be inactive for most of December because I will on vacation with family to Taiwan and Hong Kong. I'll be sure to make some pictures to backup to post to Tumblr, but dA might be a bit dry during those times since I can't upload via dA's mobile app. Anyway, here's Yukikaze from Dog Days as per requested by , Hope you guys enjoy it!

He'll probably just end up eating all 3 and falling asleep under the table. category explanation: this was equally torn between digital, traditional, anthro, fantasy and anime categories. traditional won out because the colouring was pretty much effortless and only done because a lotta people can't seem to handle the idea of lineart NOT being coloured in, and ask me if they can colour things, and then do something aweful like use the colour blue. the lineart was done with a magical secret pen from vv. anime won out because I don't consider umicorms to be very anthro-like, they're more like unimimis with extra fluff, and i just feel weird putting something so cartoony into fantasy, because I tend to sully that category a lot with my crap when most people who go there probably want to see crying airbrushed faeries and badass warrior breastlady paintings that would make awesome metal album covers, and pallu, while he IS a unicorn, is neither of those. in conclusion pallu ends up gaining weight often and having to lose it in ways that tend to wear Di out, and there also needs to be a special category called \"weird gay crap\" so I don't have to always feel like I'm pissing someone off when I post, and having to use straightforward categories is holding me back from using more holographic stickers and chewing gum in my art.

I think I'll start drawing eyes like that more often. O_o; Least favorite part: the lace. Some parts of it just look........*awful*. @___@ One of the rare RARE pictures I think I'm somewhat happy with, so I hope you guys like it. This actually didn't take as long as I thought it would, *technically* speaking....about 8.5 hours total. However, the initial 1.5 hours was a botched first coloring of it that I had to completely erase and start over on. @_@; So this actually got 2 coloring jobs....it's not obvious, but I had to experiment with a lot of new coloring techniques to make her have the right look--coloring her in my usual style didn't seem to work. -___-; I sort of liked the colors before I monochromed it, so I included the link up there too...but it didn't have the antique look I wanted, so I decided to just stick with this. (Thanks, , for the desaturated suggestion!) Lots of playing around with saturation levels on different layers. Little roses at bottom are photomanipulated, with odd pearl-y things tacked on...pose inspired by some random Audrey Hepburn photo I saw somewhere. Prints coming soon for this one. This is getting long.... @_@; Anyways, here's the text that goes along with the picture--an excerpt from the story this girl is in. *** \" .... A moment later Amadeus walked by, his attention riveted to the lovely young lady by his side. I peered over the crowd to see her for the first time. I'd seen her likeness before, of course. We all had. Her portraits colonized the halls of the Intelligence Academy and reminded me every day how futile my attraction to Amadeus was. How could anyone refuse her? Medaia-Ateer Areion, heir to the throne of Sobri e'Lan. She carried the queen's ancient beauty with her own porcelain, doll-like face and pale gold curls, her perfect neck tilted ever-so-slightly toward her escort, her perfect hands resting contentedly around his arm. Her elegant stride and intelligent manners forced me to shrink back into the masses to hide my embarrassment. How silly I was to think, even for a moment, that Amadeus loved me when he could choose such a princess instead. Poor common country girl. I was such a fool.\" -- Kiele Padesca, upon seeing the Sobri e'Lan princess for the first tme. (Note: This narrating Kiele is the human version of my anthro rp that pops up now and then.

This obsession is no doubt rooted in my childhood visits to my grandma's house, where I would repeatedly watch the movie.

In this one, ariel was blonde, freckled, hung out with a dolphin, and she died at the end. ...I was a really weird kid. The VHS vanished suddenly one day, but I never fully forgot about it. Then out of nowhere A CERTAIN FRIEND NAMED CAT OR SOMETHING popped up at school with the old thing on DVD. And we were reunited during a bout of illustrator homework. It dawned on me that between the visuals and the audio, this film was almost the equivalent of stabbing myself to death. And I love it anyway. Amaya is kind of my own little mermaid, despite the fact that she's not half fish. So i wanted to do a couple of pieces with her, inspired by the old Hans Christian Andersen tale.

The officer in charge of it promptly forgot about it when he misplaced the map of its location, and told no-one in his embarrassment. The staff remained in suspended animation for thousands of years, until apocalyptic events defrosted the facility. In the thawed post-apocalypse, the researchers continued their work underground, unaware of what had happened to them and the world above. Over the course of time they developed a series of increasingly compact tanks, eventually culminating in a model that could be worn by an operator like a sort of exo-suit. When they finally ran out of food, the staff sent up Petia - the daughter of the assistant mechanic - along with the tank suit to contact their superior and request additional rations. But behold! The post-post-apocalyptic world had been transformed! The nuclear fallout combined with cosmic radiation and wild superstitions had given birth to a WORLD OF MAGIC. Ghouls and ghosts, dungeons and dragons, everywhere! But the Soviet Union and communism were nowhere to be found. Petia shot and killed an orc and brought it back to her nerd family, who dined on the charred corpse as they listened to her story in wonder. After a lengthy discussion amongst themselves, everybody decided that yes, it sucked that their friends, family, and country were dead, but that it was pretty cool that America was too, and now would be a sweet time to take over the world with their tank and propagate the joys of communist doctrine. And so, since Petia has the least health problems, they send her out in their latest tank model: the TI-83 (unrelated to the graphing calculator of the same name). Petia then joins up with Lin-Lin the witch in a quest to overthrow the current ruler of Eurasia, who I guess is a demon lord or something. Even though the TI-83 has armor, cannons, and treads, it is not a true tank in the sense that it is really more of a girl. This picture took a long time, but damn am I satisfied. I think I'm liking the look of the thin lines + gradient coloring style. A lot of the TI-83's design is inspired by the tech from my employer's work in progress, Firefall. Download for 1920x1200 version! Made in Flash EDIT: Several of you have brought to my attention that \"Petia\" is a Russian boy's name. The online source I got the name from said it was a Slavic\/Bulgarian girl's name, so I was like \"meh, close enough,\" but apparently it was too close to something else. So I'll say her parents were Bulgarian, and not Russian. Or they really wanted a boy.","medium":null,"title":"Tankmage JohnSu Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings JohnSu","url":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/art\/Tankmage-200279140\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"TankmageJohnSuWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsJohnSuimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/2d92\/th\/pre\/i\/2011\/069\/a\/e\/tankmage_by_johnsu-d3b8odg.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"aiki-ame","description":"my oc...Mi3~ This oc was originally inspired by mp3.

His brother was a frail child and often gets sick easily and on his tenth birthday he was in his worst state. The doctors told him that his brother could only live on for 12 days. The boy loved his brother so much that he was willing to sell the cow and wagon they owned so that he could afford the medical fees, but in the end nothing could be done to save the boy's brother. The brother however accepted the fate that he will die and requested that he want to spend his last Christmas with his brother. But sadly Christmas is on the 13th day. Desperate to fulfill his brother's wish, the boy went to the village witchdoctor to seek help. The Witchdoctor in the village then told the boy if he was brave enough to venture into the deep forrest he might be able to find a special kind of flower that blooms every night, and the flower could stop a body from aging for 1 day, but to get the flower he must pay a price. On the second day the boy went into the forests to look for that flower, After 2 days he came across a cave with many weird looking statues around it, and inside the cave was a big stone clock with flowers blooming on the walls. The boy who was sure that he had found the flower plucked a handful of them to bring back to his brother. As the boy was about to leave the cave he was stopped by a barrier surrounding the entrance, and the guardian of the cave appeared in front of him. The guardian said that he had trespassed a forbidden realm that was only allowed for deities and he needs to pay the price for stealing the flowers. Scared but determined the boy begged for mercy and made a deal to the guardian that he would come back on the day after christmas to accept his punishment as long as he was able to celebrate christmas with his brother. Suprisingly, the guardian swiftly agreed. So in the end the boy went back to his home and indeed his brother made it through the 12th day and they celebrated christmas together, and on the 13th day his brother passed away. The next day the boy went back to the cave to accept his punishment, the guardian then told him that he was to be turned into a statue to live in misery everyday, but since the guardian was moved by the boy's kind heart towards the brother he cast a sleeping spell on the boy and planted a seed in him. And when the time comes for the flower to bloom within him he will be ascended into heaven to reunite with his brother. 1000 years past and what was left of the boy is a smiling statue covered with flowers that he has once used to save his brother. end ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","medium":null,"title":"Twelve Days Toonikun Watch Manga & Anime Traditional Media Drawings Toonikun","url":"https:\/\/toonikun.deviantart.com\/art\/Twelve-Days-122582630\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Traditional Media","Drawings"],"filename":"TwelveDaysToonikunWatchMangaAnimeTraditionalMediaDrawingsToonikunimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/toonikun.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/3d50\/i\/2009\/135\/a\/e\/twelve_days_by_toonikun.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Green"],"artist":"the10s","description":"2\/3 train illustration done.

The only person he respected is his father. 2 Royal Knights Captains, Duncan and Arsha were brought in to tutor him in the way of a prince after King Arcan got tired of Kiaz's trouble making. When he was 14, a military coup led by his distant uncle, the Lord of Allis, Maxwell Windsarm, forced him to abandon his home. His father dying in the blaze that razed the royal castle to it's foundation. He fled towards the realm of Highwind, with only his 2 loyal guardians, Ducan and Arsha, barely avoiding the chasing Allisian army, he managed to meet up with the army of the Lord of Highwind, Goals Windsarm. To prevent the Allisian army from catching Kiaz, the Highwind army was order to engage the Allisian army. In the ensuring battle, the inexperienced Highwind army was routed by the more experienced and better trained Allisian Army. Kiaz and the survivors barely managed to retreat behind the High mountain passes, where troops led by Duncan managed to make a stand and force the Allisian to retreat After reaching the capital of Highwind, Kiaz begin making controversial decisions in regard to common practices, first by promoting his two loyal Captains, Ducan and Arsha to Generals of the army (The law of Kingdom of Windariam only allow a single general for each realm), then he allow Ciltic (a long time enemy of the Kingdom) warriors into the army, granting them citizenship as Windariam citizens. And later to even his Generals' displeasure, he appointed the Black Druid Lia as chief military advisor. While his critics in Highwind blame this on his arrogance, they were unknown to fact that, the last words of King Arcan to Kiaz was that a great man must be willing to make scarifices, and that so he did, by swallowing his pride as Prince. He went on to trade off Windariam greatest military secret to form an alliance with the sea faring island Kingdom of Aquos, and frequetly clashes with his own allies in Highwind, so that better men and equipment can be gathered for his army. One of his wiser decision were to reorganise his army under direction of the Black Driud Lia, who had long travelled beyond borders of Windariams and studied the art of war from various nations. This new army beared equipments far more advanced than those of the rest of Windariam. It was this time in Highwind, he took to seriously studying and learning to fight. Guided by Nobutsuna, he soon adopted various fighting methods together his own royal family Twin Blade fighting Techniques. During battles he will brought along various lengths of blades on both side of his thights, so as to use them when and where he see fit. 5 years after his forced exile to Highwind, he led the reorganised Highwind army out of the mountain region, and quickily retake the Capital of La Tene while King Maxwell were busy dealing with Ciltic intrusions of Allis lands in the south. But he was caught by surprise as the Southern Cilts suddenly retreated and allow Maxwell to turn back to deal with Kiaz's attack. Heavily outnumbered 3 to 1, Kiaz decided to divide his forces to delay and destroy the Vanguard armies seperately. Both Duncan and Arsha were given orders to utterly crash their opposites before linking up with Kiaz who will only lead a small force to delay the main vanguard army. However at Barrack Bridge, despite Lia's recommended plans to delay the enemy by ruse, Kiaz decided a more risky attack after sighting his sworn enemy, King Maxwell leading that vanguard army. He placed his elite cavalry, the Gale Cavalry in plain sight directed for a charge at the bridge shall any dare to cross, while Kiaz with commanding the 3rd Cavalry Corps hide out of sight of the Allisian across the river. When the tides lowered the river level, the Allisian army begin crossing the river in full formation. This was what Kiaz had waited for, as the Allisian army was disorganised crossing the river, Kiaz ordered a arrow barrage before charging straight into Allisian army in the river. The river were soon turn red in the ensuring battle as the Allisian spearmen hindered by water and out of formation were hacked down or crushed by the Highwind cavalry... But Allisian numbers begin to tell, as the Highwind charge started to lose its early momentum ~Side notes~ All members of the royal Family were born with silver hair making them look older than they actually are. The sword Kiaz carry in this battle is one half of the twin blades, known as the Wings of Windsarm, a royal Heirloom. ~Some personal notes~ Well, well, well, this guy had been laying in my W.I.P timetable for I think for almost a year? Well~ he's meant to be the main character among the main characters of the story I was writing, so I wasn't about to hold back on anything but the best of my skill for him.

Uhm, some people during stream mentioned that she looks a bit like ~Kaze-Hime's Okami Gijinka of Amaterasu, but that was sort of coincidental; I just went with the colours that would match rather than anything else (Red > Purple, White > Black) Anyway otherwise not much else to say- After the next two CG commissions are up Imma be chibi bombing all over stream to catch up on those. It does make me ever so much more productive @_@ I apologize in advance to everyone whose minds will suffer destruction during the process....

The main objective of the game is to explore and wander around her dreams.) In case you're curious, here's a link list with stuff where you can get the game and all that: [link] Anyway, it's not fanart, it's more like a tribute, since I wanted to try basically something similar, except with my own dreams and stuff I have seen there.

Lots and lots of effort went into this artwork. >_> The original sketch was done on A2 sized paper - that's the approx size of 4 Letter sized pieces of paper stuck together. Then I scanned it in in 6 sections, pieced it back together, digitally inked it, and then CGed it in PhotoShop CS. >____> 300 dpi at A2 size, with over 100 layers, and ending up at 400MBs in file size when it was finished. IT WAS TORTURE OF THE CRUELEST KIND. Because my compie couldn't really handle it and it took ages to load and save!!! ... But enough complaining about the pains of artage. Onto the picture... Phoenix and Aether, dueling under the moonlight above the world. Kou-sama said it looked \"romantic\" and I'm like... how is that romantic??? Phoenix is trying to stab Aether through the neck, and Aether is taunting him with a ha-ha, you missed smirk! The threads of light coming out of Aether's wings and stabbing into Phoenix are a reference to the ceremony in which he sold half of his soul to own Phoenix (yeah, for those who don't know, Aether has an obsession with Phoenix... as in the YAOI\/BL kinda way - Phoenix should be grateful that he's got all his clothes on in this picture!). Technically... Aether doesn't have wings anymore 'cause he tore them off after they refused to obey him. >_> But I'm a lover of wings on bishis, and he'll probably get them back some day. >_> No, that wasn't just a spoiler of any kind. Blah! Long story short... this will be available as a print at the 2006 Syd Sept\/Oct Animania [link] and the 2006 Syd Supanova [link] hopefully as A2 prints (without the icky watermark over the image, of course!). Look for the giant wall scroll of this image to find me in the Artists Alley if you're going.

I did this one as a study of just boy or men manga eyes. The other one was mostly women eyes. I picked some of the most popular male eyes and my most favorite. I will not say what characters each eyes comes from, because these are just tools to create unique and differing character in the same manga, comic, or anime. Plus it's also just fun to let you guess. I hope you like them there are more eyes here than on my last one. I think between the 2 pictures there are 58 different eyes. I love eyes, there just something about the eye that can really make a character. Well I hope you guys like it and I hope you find it useful. God Bless and keep on creating. Here a link to my other Manga eyes pic [link] In case you didn't know shonen means boy. EDIT-08\/20\/2012 I added a few new eyes to the list. I realized I didn't have my own characters eye on the list so I added it. His eye is number 11. I also added number 22 and 33. Number 22 is Mashiro's from Bakuman and Number 33 is Takagi's also from Bakuman. They look hard to draw but there pretty easy, because they're made with short straight lines instead of long curving lines. Numbers 43 and 44 are also new. I consider these two eyes to be cool but also they're the easiest eyes to draw. You just start by drawing either a circle or oval and add a thicker upside down semicircle line to the top and a thin straight line to the bottom. And the iris's are super easy just a solid circle or oval. These eyes are for those that comment and say they can't draw eyes. You can draw these! I also, obviously, added numbers for those who like to comment on specific eyes.","medium":null,"title":"Manga Eyes Shonen Godsartist Watch Manga & Anime Traditional Media Drawings Godsartist","url":"https:\/\/godsartist.deviantart.com\/art\/Manga-Eyes-Shonen-101590894\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Manga & Anime","Traditional Media","Drawings"],"filename":"MangaEyesShonenGodsartistWatchMangaAnimeTraditionalMediaDrawingsGodsartistimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/godsartist.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/339c\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/232\/c\/c\/manga_eyes_shonen_by_godsartist-d1ohg1a.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"Agarwen","description":"GRACIAS POR LOS 1198 WATCHERS !!!planeaba agradecer cuando llegara a los mil pero de pronto el numero subio muy rapido n\/\/\/n ..gracias Pues este es el diseÃ±o final de mi personaje principal,fue muy complicado,pero finalmente este fue el resultado,espero les guste, esta sera la portada de mi proximo manga..adoro mis acuarelas n_n Tambien quiero agradecerlas a todos y todas las personas lindas que me han apoyado n_n y me han otorgado su watch!!!llegue a los 1198 watchers n_n..en verdad muchas gracias!!!prometo seguirme esforzandome dia a dia y dar todo por mejorar n_n abrazos a todos y buena vibra VISITEN THANKS FOR THE WATCHERS 1198! planned to thank when he got a thousand but then the number went up so fast n \/ \/ \/ n .. thanks For this is the final design of my main character was very complicated, but ultimately this was the result, I hope you like it, this will be the cover of my next manga I love my watercolors .. n_n I also want to thank each and everyone pretty n_n who supported me and given me his watch! watchers get to 1198 .. n_n thank you very much indeed! promise to continue to strive every day and give everything to improve n_n hugs to all and good vibes VISIT","medium":null,"title":"CHAOS Agarwen Watch Manga & Anime Traditional Media Drawings Agarwen","url":"https:\/\/agarwen.deviantart.com\/art\/CHAOS-192356728\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Traditional Media","Drawings"],"filename":"CHAOSAgarwenWatchMangaAnimeTraditionalMediaDrawingsAgarwenimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/agarwen.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/1686\/th\/pre\/i\/2011\/005\/4\/2\/chaos_by_agarwen-d36iveg.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," White"],"artist":"sundayshu","description":":U \/ I'm doing concepts like this.

Hooray! This weekend I met my first new (or refurbished) laptop - a Compaq Presario V6120US. She actually arrived at the beginning of the week, but I was at school so I couldn't see her until I returned home. ;_; Well, she's a good, shiny machine. Took two hours of notes with it in lecture this morning and played some Kirby during the break with like 10% battery left to spare. This could be the start of a good quarter. This picture, too, was drawn from my laptop! I'm having a bit of trouble adjusting to it, though, since it's wide-screen is just another way of saying midget-screen and I'm not sure how intense the color on the display really is. Well, gotta start somewhere. But enough about awesome laptops and their lap-searing potential. You may have noticed that this is the third girl I've drawn with the vacant =D expression; this is actually something I picked up from Hidamari Sketch. This will probably not be the last time you see this. I've also tried coloring her hair in the style of Manabi Straight. And as long as I'm throwing links at you and advertising stuff, catch! It's an online orgy of video game music and a lesser orgy of anime music for you otaku out there. I'm just doing this out of the goodness of my heart and some other shady ulterior motives. Made in Flash EDIT: Alright, I was hoping I wouldn't have to explain the holes in her skirt, but it might be that some of you have no experience with laptops whatsoever. Laptops get very hot when running, so placing it on top of your lap is actually not so good an idea as the name would suggest.

People liked her so i did a little gathering of ideas and votes for her Alias name and powers. He \u201Csuper\u201D name was decided as \u201CMeta Maiden\u201D and her powers were tied on \u201Cmaking peoples thoughts visible\u201D and \u201CTemporarilly getting powers she reads in comics\u201D. Since those are two powers, and the later could be OP, my take is as follows: She is normally just a girl with the power of making people\u2019s superficial thoughts visible, and she uses it to piss of people or blackmail them, but then she can read a comic and transform into the costume kinda like Green lantern does, then she stops having the mind reading power and is instead substituted by the power she read about. This power would last a small ammount of time (maybe about 30 minutes) , and then the transformation would stop. For this power i think it could work something similar to Re: Creators; that the power comes from readers acceptance, meaning that if a lot of people have read, for example, superman, their collective minds would give power to her impersonation, but if someone just draws a few pages of a super op character, it would not work since only a handfull of people know it and most people would not accept a stupid op character for no reason. This is kind of a way to express the Comicsgate concept of not accepting stupid Mary sue diverse characters who have no meaning beyond injecting politics: Only real characters that people like would power her. Also since the power really comes from peoples minds, when she uses it with a character\u2019s powers, she \u201Cdrains\u201D readers for a while, meaning she can\u2019t transform into the same character again until some long time passes and readers \u201Crecharge\u201D by reading new comics of that character. That way she can\u2019t just spam the most op one, and have to resort to picking the best one each situation. Some characters in fact may have so little readers (or be so old) that she can\u2019t repeat them in years, or never.","medium":null,"title":"Connie Brooks: Meta maiden KukuruyoArt Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings #metamaiden #conniebrooks #ComicsGate","url":"https:\/\/kukuruyoart.deviantart.com\/art\/Connie-Brooks-Meta-maiden-708715945\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"ConnieBrooksMetamaidenKukuruyoArtWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsmetamaidenconniebrooksComicsGateimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/kukuruyoart.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/cf8c\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/281\/0\/b\/connie_brooks__meta_maiden_by_kukuruyoart-dbpy8q1.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Green"],"artist":"JenniferHealy","description":"Another one that I'm not too sure where to put it.

I was trying to stay with the quasi-gothic mood. Sorry. ; - About the pic - _________________ Another small project that turned into a big one. I was just trying to relearn Loth's character design, because bishies are my weak spot. I can't draw one to save my life. Anyway, it turned into...a detailed sketch which I was determined not to spend much time on. So I started coloring it and I hated it for about 8 hours over the course of 3 days until it was finally done, and I hated it a little less. In some places I complete erased my lineart (Hal's wings, some hair, etc), but I still haven't got the balls to completely do away with it. I'm a wuss. Pencil sketch on cardstock ( Here's the original sketch: [link] ) CG with Photoshop 7 - About the scene - Loth, in order to peacefully protest heaven's shabby treatment of humans, gives up the luxury of having wings. So naturally he's a bit saddened when his little sister is ready for her first flight. Hal's a smart kid, so she knows it hurts him... instead of rushing off carelessly with her new gift, she takes a moment to visit him and honor his sacrifice. The title \"Whispers of Melancholy\" refers to the bittersweet blessing that Loth bestows on her during the embrace. She's younger than usual here - this event takes place long before Fallout starts. (Of course, this scene will be reminisced about.) c\/c appreciated.

It was a short-lived battle, however, as Riley spent most of his time playing dating sims instead of building robots, and it was very much a one-sided fight. Having completed his task and outlived his purpose, the fighting robot volunteered to have himself modified into the household automaton now known as COOKING ROBOY. He is, however, terrible at this task, having no native sense of taste (USB tongue brings him only part of the way there). Coupled with the fact that he feels he ought to mass-produce everything as a machine means there is a lot failures and wasted food. His creator has long since moved on (to developing dating sims), so he has no one to cheer him on except his self-aware rice-cooker and his surrogate video game mother, Cooking Mama.

Upon hearing this rumor, three young bachelors set out to find this tree. And they found it. After a week of not being able to figure out how to obtain guidance from a tree, they decided to chop it down and see which direction it fell in so as to travel that way. However, instead of falling, the tree simple crumbled into a pile of wood at their feet. After a week of frustration and arguing, they ended up making a tub boat out of the Love Tree. They set out with it on the seas, letting the Love Wood drift them towards people they might marry. 20 years later, two of the three have settled down with families of their own, but the third guy is still out there looking for a lady. The children of his colleagues hear of his solitude and this gross boat, and out of pity and curiosity decide to join him on his adventures. From right to left, we have Nick Butcher, Pan Baker, and Judy. Nick Butcher is the only one of the original three to have not found a mate yet. Why can't the women of the world see the charm of this leathery lion-maned man who wanders the sea in a tub and always wears the same thing? Pan Baker is a pÃ¢tissier in the family business. He was born with Pillsbury disease, which causes a light, buttery dough to form on his skin when poked. It can be immediately formed into almost any kind of bread, but unfortunately it becomes stale and rock-hard within moments and smells and tastes awful. He is embarrassed by this condition. Judy is the heiress of a paraffin plant. She has spent considerable time developing Candle Arms. Her family is impressed by her focus and ingenuity, but is also concerned by her choice of how to waste her life. She secretly likes Pan, and wants to one day eat his disease bread. <\/story> Well, that was a longer story than usual, and there are a lot of unanswered questions in this picture: What are they fighting? How did they get up so high in the air? Where do they plan to go from here? I don't know. But at least I got to draw a wild old man and a peripheral girl and a bread boy. I also got to try some new clouds and landscapes! Very fun. Made in Flash EDIT: Judy still has arms.

It's never been done before! Anyhow, this is a continuation off of my Chester deviation. Let me introduce each character in their own paragraph: On the left we have the elder sister, Fida. Her role is to feed items, loot, and money to monsters so that when the player slays them, they can get some sort of instant gratification. How does she do it? That's a secret I cannot say. But what we can say for certain is that she uses her left arm for this purpose. She obtains this monster loot from the NPC guild in much the same way her brother does. On the right we have the younger brother, Hyde. His services were rejected by the NPC guild, so in retribution he steals miscellany from the treasury and in a surprise turn that no one could guess from his name, hides it (Wow!). For things like pennies and potions, he hides them in guild members' houses. Now you might ask, \"How is this retribution?\" Well, the NPC's don't know it's there, but all the players assume it is. Result: constant ransacking by player. Ancient pottery smashed, private property rummaged through, homes invaded - all because of a little trick by Hyde. Of course, the NPC guild doesn't know who's doing this, but they hate it. Hyde has various \"infiltration\" tools on his belt, flashlights on his head, and the subtlety of a boot, so he's never caught. I, however, know all this because I'm the one who suggested it to him. Anyhow, originally I was just going to make this into a scrap because I wasn't serious about Chester's siblings, but people kept egging me on and I kinda wanted to try it too. I originally wanted to make this look like a painted piece, but in the end I settled for cel-shading since my alpha approach killed the colors. I at least got to \"paint\" a messy canvas for the background, though. Hooyay. Goodnight, you.

It's hard and painful to explain, but...You have many friends...many loved ones...but for me, you're the only one that I have. My only friend, my only lover, my only one...and as much as you're the only one that I have, I wish that I was the same to you. I wish that I was the only one in your eyes...I wish that I would become your first selection. The only one that makes you smile, laugh...the only one that you'll show your weakness to. Because honestly, you are those to me. You're the only one in my eyes. The only one that excites me, makes me smile, makes me lose my mind when I see you. In a sea of many voices, even if your voice is the one that spoke last, yours is the first that I will call out to. And even if I have everything...it's all nothing to me, if it's not you. Please only be mine. Please don't second think of anyone else...let me be the only one in your eyes! I know I'm being childish, but...I'm your husband. So please don't give yourself to anyone else...don't show your eyes to anyone else. They're only mine to see..because you're mine. Do you know how much you torment me...? Do you know how tight my chest becomes when I see you with him? If you can't let him go...I won't say that I'm alright with it. I won't pretend that I'm not hurting. But...I'll always be there for you. Even if you turn your back on me, remember...You can always return back to me. You'll always be welcome. My arms will always be wide open! Because... In my arms, you're home. --EDIT\/ RESPONSE FROM DARTHROSE-- Arlaena: Kaden... I know it torments you when you see us together, happy... Yes, he may have been my first friend. My first savior. My first love. But that doesn't mean I love you less. Nor does that mean I love him more than you... I know it pains you to hear this.... I know... I know... But I want to get that out of the way first. Kaden... you are the one that makes me smile. The one that holds me together when I'm falling apart. The only one who accepts me as the flawed monster I am. The only one that has truly made me smile. The only one who has kept me alive when I have thought of ending my life because of my sins. Around you, I forget the things... the people that broke me. You say that you're holding me back, that sometimes I'm chained down, that this is childish. But... I don't see this as any sort of burden, or chain, or prison. But... if this is what our love really is, then I'll gladly live the rest of my life with you. I don't want to belong to anyone other than you. You are my everything. Without you, I'm just a sinful monster with the blood of innocent men, women and children on my hands. You are my all. If you were gone, I would accept death with glad tidings. So please, don't you dare ever let me go. Don't dare let go of me... because without you, I am lost. Without you, I have no home.

Beanchild Jack) There once lived a woman by herself on a farm, with nothing but a milk-producing cow to keep her company. Every morning she would juice the dairy out of her cow and head off to market to sell it at noon. And in the evening she would write bad poetry and feed it to her cow in embarrassment. Now there came a time when the cow's teat ran dry and the woman could no longer support the two of them. She said to her cow, \"How now, brown cow?\" Her cow looked back at the woman with her big cow eyes seeming to say, \"You should sell me at the market. You can use the money to invest in the farm and actually grow vegetables or something. You could live off of that and sell the surplus so you can buy other foodstuffs to complement your diet. I, on the other hand, will probably be eaten or turned into glue, but I'm down with that.\" \"Yes,\" said the woman, \"I shall do just that,\" and she proceeded to the market the next day. She came home with no cow and a single magic bean in hand. \"Aw, poop!\" said the woman, \"I've just realized this might not actually be magic, and could have very well been a swindle.\" It was sucks, but she decided to make the best of the situation anyway and planted the bean. A planted bean grows bean-producing beanstalks, no? Not if it's a magic bean. The next morning, the bean had grown into a beanstalk, yes, but within the bean pod was a young child! \"Aw, poop!\" said the woman, \"I don't think I can raise a bean child,\" but she was awful lonely after she had sold her cow to that suspicious businessman, so she took in the child anyhow. Luckily, the beanstalk produced only big non-magical beans after that, and the two of them were able to live off of it as per the cow's wisdom. Now there came a time when the stalk's pods ran dry and would no longer yield beans. By now it was an enormous beanstalk that poked into the heavens. While the woman\/mother was thinking about what she could sell it as if she cut it down, the beanchild Jack climbed up the beanstalk and disappeared out of sight. When the child returned, he had with him a hen that laid golden eggs! His mother was amazed by this and asked her son how he came by such a discovery. Upon learning that he had stolen it from a giant in the sky, she frowned. \"Jack, my son,\" said she, \"it is not good to steal from one's neighbors. You must return this hen at once.\" But while she was scolding the beanchild, the gold pooper hen had escaped into the wilderness. In any case, a hen had to be returned. The mother took one of their own which they had been raising and climbed up the beanstalk with her son. At the top of the beanstalk they found a great dwelling which must have stood at least the height of twenty men. Gathering her courage, the mother approached the front door and pulled the cord to ring the door bell: FEE âª FI âª FO âª FUM âª The door opened in, nearly vacuuming Jack and his mother inside. A great towering giant leaned out and peered down at them from the doorway. \"What ho!\" he boomed. \"A manling and its mother! A delightful surprise!\" And before either Jack or his mother could react, the giant picked them up and brought them inside. Once inside, the giant set down Jack and his mother on a table and sat down. \"Do tell, what brings you two to my home today? How can I help you?\" The mother looked at the giant's great yellow teeth and summoned her courage to answer as best she could. \"Sir Giant, I've come to apologize on behalf of my son Jack, who has recently bereaved you of one of your hens. I hope you will accept this hen as a token of our sincerest apologies.\" Just then, the hen laid a single egg into the bean child's palm. The giant examined the hen and her egg with a scrupulous eye. \"I appreciate your honesty, madam,\" said he, \"but unless this hen lays eggs of gold, it cannot replace the hen I've lost.\" \"But Sir Giant!\" exclaimed the mother, eager to clear the family's debt, \"Please look within the egg of brown if you will.\" The giant took the egg as a child takes an ant, and crushed it between his fingers, revealing the sticky yellow yolk. \"Liquid gold!\" he exclaimed in amazement. Upon learning that the gold itself was rich in protein and cholesterol and that the eggs could also yield golden chicks that would grow into more egg-producing hens, the giant was ecstatic. In his gratitude, he accepted the farm hen and even gave the mother and child a milk-less cow he had received when he sold magic beans (different magic beans, that is) to a suspicious man. And then everyone went home safely and had food to eat and work to do and that was good enough. Alternate Ending: Jack speaks. The talk goes downhill. The giant eats everyone. The End.

I actually tried (drumroll pleeeease) ...a BACKGROUND..! It's like, a city. And some mountains. And some clouds. Cheap, airbrushed clouds. So this is a picture of my char Halcyon flying. It took me about 6-7 hours from start to finish, which is longer than I usually take... started out with 8.5x11 cardstock and a .5mm pencil, took about an hour or two to draw it. The rest was CGing with Photoshop 7... used 5 layers at the most. I tried to make the city look like it was foggy or something. And yeah, I gave Hal the same sort of details as in the Gothic Rei pic.. I'm trying to refine my design style. Yay. I like this pic a lot better, though, because it has much better composition. Like, the lower 3\/4 of it doesn't suck. (like it did in the Gothic Rei pic.) I didn't waste any space. I tried to use a blurring effect to show that she's flapping her wings. I didn't just blur everything to show general motion, as I have before. More effort = better, in my opinion. If you don't like my blurring, then that's too bad. I don't do it to hide my crappy line work, I do it to better convey the action in the picture. i.e., she's flapping her wings and it's windy. I don't expect to stop doing it any time soon. That's enough ranting. I should do more backgrounds.","medium":null,"title":"Freefall fallout161 Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings fallout161","url":"https:\/\/fallout161.deviantart.com\/art\/Freefall-1352374\/?purchase=print&itemids=118","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"Freefallfallout161WatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsfallout161image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$96.00","artistURL":"https:\/\/fallout161.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/09b4\/i\/2003\/8\/d\/6\/freefall.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"mazmazbosschan","description":"Based by BlackWargreymon from personal Digimon RP fan group.","medium":null,"title":"Hunter Neville mazmazbosschan Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings mazmazbosschan","url":"https:\/\/mazmazbosschan.deviantart.com\/art\/Hunter-Neville-677440036\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"HunterNevillemazmazbosschanWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsmazmazbosschanimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/mazmazbosschan.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/1bb6\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/117\/3\/1\/hunter_neville_by_mazmazbosschan-db7bw2s.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Atomic-Clover","description":"[EDIT] i changed it so Luci no longer had a wonky eye. haha satan had a lazy eye XD it is Lucifer from my manga. i wanted to use lighter, softer colors to represent the angel of light before he fell from his place next to God. Luci's really fun to draw :3 i started making a coloring tutorial with this picture, but i think im just gonna do a 'face and hair' tutorial 'cause when i got to colouring the wings and clothes, i had no idea what i was doing, and thus would make for a really crappy tutorial. . . 'so first you do this colour here, and then white over here, but that looks crappy, so go over with this, and then smudge a little of this over here... (five hours and a bajillion pictures later) and this is how you get the cape!' yeah would probably just make ppl angry. this picture was super fun tho 8D i was playing with so many colors, and then ZOMG WHITE-OUT. SO MUCH FUN. even tho the stuff i was using was 4 years old, and kinda gooey and clumpy, it was really fun to throw around and stuff, i have whiteout all over my face and hands and arms, i dont know how... it's also on part of my computer. i need to clean that off before my dad sees that. but yeah, white-out eez GUUD. and the reason there's an anarchy symbol in the middle of the pentagram is 'cause of a verse from 1 John 3:4, which says that sin is lawlessness, and anarchy is lawlessness, so ergo anarchy is the epitome of sin, making the anarchy symbol the sybmol of sin. if a = b, and b = c, right? c: excuse me while i go take a very much needed shower now. \"You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.

Guess what - I finished a drawing that started out nice and normal but then became a nearly 2 year monster project. Well, 2 years with looooot's of pauses. I started the sketch so long ago I can't even remember (probably around March 2012), and the outlines took me already weeks, over 50 hours of work in total. I don't know how much time I spent on color, but it must have been even more ORZ. I had huge problems with deciding on color (I'm reaaally bad at picking fitting colors T_T), that's why I took many, many breakes. I had a color scheme on mind (there was some red in there at first) before I left for Japan (August 2012) but randomly drew another pic (Cosmos) before finishing this one. I didn't expect to go to Japan twice before finishing this drawing >_> Anyway, I'm kinda glad it's finally done but I'm also not that happy with how it turned out. There is just TOO MUCH STUFF GOING ON. I didn't even manage to find better background colors... I even dropped one pattern (for the bottom kimono, the same one as in her hair) but it's still too chaotic... oh well... if you work too long on one piece, you put in to many details. Maybe I will change stuff in some weeks. Who knows.

With her innocent silver eyes, delicate lips, and that long, silky orange hair, this girl possesses an effortlessly attractive beauty that is a cross between an angel and a princess. I couldn't resist vectoring such a fine looking scan. Before I always found it hard to vector characters in their kimono, especially in extravagant ones, but Orihime pushed me to do it. I'm pretty impressed with her character design. She totally fits the part of a noble Japanese woman in the past. And I just love the hair. Vectoring the hair was a bit difficult since it's all over the place, but it was fun coloring it and adding highlights. The patterns on the kimono are made from brushes. I adjusted the shape dynamics and made them scatter. Oh, by the way, I'm not good at vectoring flowers, so pardon me if it came out strange. But the Iris\/Ayame is a really pretty flower.

I did this a bit hurriedly and therefore the Wiesel came out a little off on the actual proportions. The girls poses and proportions are also a little low on quality. Still I tried to make up for that by trying add as much detail as I could think of. I think it's a fairly decent work but I need to improve further on quality and time it takes to do these pictures. Anyways I hope you like this. More pictures of my OCs will be coming soon hopefully before I start taking in the next batch of commisions.

She is trying to escape with her new friend, Lockhead Martin - a shy boy with no nipples and no face. With his help, they've managed to find a way for her to return home, but the Key to Getting Out of Here is quickly getting out of here. And all the time this lion guy keeps huffing along behind them, gasping something inaudibly. Oh yeah, the lion's name is Lady Killer. His associates call him \"Mr. Killer,\" but he prefers to go by \"Lady.\" He is very popular at the club he works for. Hidden behind Lady: a small dog <\/synopsis> Well, here's my first \"serious\" illustration of the year, for lack of better words. Normally the subject I enjoy drawing most is the girl, but this time I think my favorite is Lady Killer. ~swoon~ Anyhow, I tried something new this time in that I drew the foreground in Flash, but painted the background in Paint Tool SAI. I'm liking SAI, but I still need to get the hang of making things not look...muddy. Blending colors is fun, but I want to keep the contrast that makes things interesting. I also need to figure out how to handle the brush to get strokes the size and shape I want. Maybe I'll have to watch a digital painter paint one of these days...

I spent 4 days or so on this... prolly around 10 to 12 hours. Most of it was spent on the CG. Cel shading takes sooo long. But check out Emie's pants.. OMG that took forever. I'm not completely satisfied with it (note the crappy bg), and Hal's legs are too short, but other than that, I like it. Emie is on the left, Hal is on the right. Emie is smaller and younger, and she isn't a fallen angel so her wings are intact. Also, they have shiny hair. If you select Somewhat Like Deviation or Dislike Deviation, PLEASE give some kind of reason. Anything will do, but I can't make my art better unless you tell me what's wrong with it, can I?

It did not look like its neighbors in the Solar System. Planet Earth is beautiful and unique in its kind. It is our home. It is covered with dense forests, high mountains and deep oceans, an entity in its splendor. It is like a living organism, a virgin girl's body. It is inhabited with a huge number of beings, but the crown of its creation is human. Billions of people such different or similar to each other live on our planet. Everyone has their own character and habits. If there is no anger in person and the harmony reign in his heart, then the Earth feels good. The world around becomes bright, kind and colorful. And your heart rejoices in every moment, noticing the smallest details of nature's beauty: airy flying butterflies, fresh breeze or heavy ears of wheat on the field. Our planet is like a pearl among the black depths of space. And there are a lot of evil in the galaxy, which wants to take over the most precious of our treasure - our home. But it will not succeed! Because it will always be protected by the great guardian, strong and fearless warrior within the all universe - by Sailor Moon! She - a fighter for good and justice. The courageous and brave girl, whose pure heart is overflowing with love for this planet, the world and people around. Not afraid of anything, she is ready to defend what is dear to her, even if it will cost her own life! And Evil will fade in the light of her magic power of good. There is only one enemy that Sailor Moon is not able to cope - human vices. If people keep rage within their hearts and hate each other, the planet will feel it and will suffer. If the Earth will be mired in the darkness inside it, nothing will be able to save our planet. Even the healing power of Sailor Moon\u2019s love is not enough to defeat these human demons. Thus, be pure within your heart and take care of our home from inside. And the very powerful warrior of the moon will protect us from the other enemies.

Second: She is a gurl. I generally try to make it a habit to never expose the stomach of a male character if his chest is covered. Alright, so the subject of this picture is a girl named Sonya Treble. She travels about the world by transmitting herself along telephone lines, collecting\/pirating music across time and space in an effort to create a symphony that can dance her BACK TO THE MOON. I have a headache and need to go lie down for a while. Anyhow, I had fun with this one - there were like 8 scrapped poses that all looked pretty cool but failed to capture her spunk. Good fun practice, though. Originally she was going to hold a giant phone in her hand and a dog named Cell, but I felt it would weigh her down too much and decided that at most she'd have an antenna in her cap and headphones that were hooked up to her pants.

One of Dr. Maggie Kim's closest friends. She teaches at one of the leading Universities in the capital. She is a biology professor, teaching mostly about Body Morphasia as well as it's history and effects on life. Many of her students are morphasians themselves. She often has to teach seminars in giant auditoriums. She also has a thing for younger college men. Though she is in her late 30's, her exagerative figure, and sultry nature to the endowed boys at the school, makes it easy for her to find someone to keep her bed warm. Sadly though she is good at finding a nice lay, she has terrible luck on dates, often due to her ass sabotaging her. Bianca claim's she is not a morphasian, that her ass is naturally this fat. Maggie has had doubts but no one has seen pictures of her in her 20's, so no one can be sure.

Once I started drawing it though, the image changed. I decided to draw her trapped, captured, unable to do what she wants. A lot like artists nowadays. There is so much complaining on all sides about what people draw that a lot of artists are pressured into changing their styles or the content of their drawings just to please others (or to avoid criticism). Anyway, I tried a lot of new techniques with this picture, and it came out a bit strange, but I like the direction it took, and I want to try to work on and refine the techniques I used here. I was going to wait til after I finished posting my otakon pictures, but I decided to go ahead and put this up now that I finished it.

Mai Suzume and her master, Mr. Salzedo Mai is a handler by trade: she installs handles onto things and makes them better. Weapons, doors, cups, people, you name it. BAM! Handle. Better. Mr. Salzedo is a small old man. He is Mai's master and father figure, having taken her in from the streets and teaching her the fine art of handling. Bermuda is their fish. He was born in bucket by the sea to a mermaid\/walrus couple. For years he thrived under their loving care, until a violent tide separated him from his family. Bermuda wandered the coastline for months until he was captured by a hungry beach bear. Almost died, then and there. Fortunately, he was saved by a passing ranger who had been looking to settle a score with the sandy ursine. At the duel's conclusion, the ranger took Bermuda back home with him to surprise his wife - and surprise her he did! She was deathly afraid of fish, and threw him out the window within the moment. Mr. Salzedo had been overseeing Mai's work on the ranger's carpet, and took notice of the flying fish. The old master leapt out the window and caught the fish within his wrinkled maw before the gulls could have their fill. When their work was good and done, the handler and his apprentice returned to their lodging and housed Bermuda in a bowl they had fashioned from a hat and a jug. There Bermuda enjoyed the rich long life of a handler's fish until old age and hedonism claimed his life. Moving forward, Mai and Salzedo take their beloved Bermuda out to sea to bury him where he was born (which would arguably be a bucket, but they don't know that). Oh yeah, also they live in a kingdom built on the back of a giant golem. That's that thing you see in the back. The experiment here was in using a bright, psychedelic palette (inspired by Egoraptor's \"pinks and yellows\"). It was fun, although very unnatural for the me who likes dusty browns and cool greys. It was a good stretch, though, and I would like to try more of this stuff in the future. The other experiment was to try shoujo eyes. Aria taught me that shoujo eyes can look pretty nice, too.

I hadn't made plans on the cover at the time I started this - so thanks to Mira for the suggestion. Before I go through the list of who's-who and their element, I'd like to point out, due to crits from previous images of them, I fully understand if you dissagree with a colour or such to represent an element (or even what classifies as an element). But please understand that there are no set rules for this, and my colours are chosen based on what I PERSONALLY felt suited them. Also, sans some obvious (Crystal, Light and Dark ect) MOST of them are actually considered an element in one or more cultures. This is also, of course, fantasy and fun. It's not supposed to be real or true-to-life (ha! Obviously!) and so it's my choice as an artist on what I choose to use. Please respect that and don't complain that I'm 'wrong'. If you dissagree, go spend a few years designing your own ones, then.

Anyhow, one day the Sawnosed Baron busts into her unsustainable business and announces he is taking it over as the base of his operations, and commands his adorable little underlings to seize the property, but Tsukiyo's like \"Please don't,\" and puts up a fight. Meanwhile, the walrus guy is drinking his fish-juice tea and says \"Whoah, that's a nice action shot\" and takes a picture and uploads it to his blog, and I'm surfing the internet and I see this picture and I'm like \"Oh wow, this can't be a photo, it looks so anime,\" so I download it, slap my name on it and then submit it to deviantArt as my own work. \"No one must ever know\" I say to myself from my darkened room, illuminated only by the monitor's glow.

I found it recently and decided maybe i should touch it up again and post it up. I was in Ikebukuro when i snapped a photo outside lawsons store with all the highways outside that look kinda awesome. I drew the lines over the background photo i took and started adding in characters of my own inside. The reason why they were so many fishes swimming around is because we missed out the sunshine aquarium and did not visit it. subsequently when we decide to head back the following year, it was closed for renovation Anyways, so if u notice, the fishes are swimming to sunshine city where the aquarium is. i wanted it to be like an ocean but right in the middle of the streets of Ikebukuro. If u look closer up to the top right hand corner, you can see Angela and me lol I hope everyone would enjoy this picture as much as i enjoyed this honeymoon 5years back I love my wife! thanks for dropping by!","medium":null,"title":"Waves in Tokyo dcwj Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Paintings dcwj","url":"https:\/\/dcwj.deviantart.com\/art\/Waves-in-Tokyo-426457463\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Paintings"],"filename":"WavesinTokyodcwjWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaPaintingsdcwjimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/dcwj.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/a836\/th\/pre\/i\/2014\/012\/5\/9\/waves_in_tokyo_by_dcwj-d71wgon.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Teaserd","description":"At last, it's finished!

Transformation Info: \"Virgo Zodiac Power!\" Thank you =Kate-Chan for helping on the background and the special effects. I LOVE YOU!! I based Sailor Virgo on: 1. The Mythology of Virgo 2. On myself 3. My mother (I love her so much and she is actually a Cancer. I love you MOM!!! You are the best mom ever!!!) Virgo does not have to be a young innocent maiden. Virgo, to me, she represents a strong and gentle woman. A warrior. A mother. A sister. A friend. Throughout history, people look at the constellation Virgo and remind themselves the goddesses such as Isis, Ishtar, Athena, Hera. Even the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. I am trying to break off the stereotype of Virgo. Virgo is the mother, the angelic maiden, a sister, the lady of the heavens, the spirit of justice, innocence, and wisdom, a woman. That is Virgo. I am a passionate Virgo. I take pride of my zodiac sign. I can say is this. \"LONG LIVE VIRGO!!!\" \"Iam redit et virgo, redeunt Saturnia Regna\" The Virgin and the Days of Old return","medium":null,"title":".:Sailor Zodiac Virgo:.

Her boat sails in the sky, so it is a sky steam boat. Also she uses it to go \"sky-fishing\" (as depicted here), so it is actually a sky fishing steam boat. Her crew consists of her father (the former captain) and a handful of other sky-fishers. They make a living off of moderating gull populations and also turning them into beautiful hats and soups. Twinn earned her nickname from her cat-ear-like ribbon and the fact that she sometimes forgets to remove the tail-like rope from her waist when she comes back from fishing. Also, she is quiet like a cat swinging through the air at 80 mph towards an unsuspecting bird. Sometimes her crew calls her \"Cattain\" instead of \"Captain\" and then she hits them with a tool because it is a stupid joke and not her name but she still loves them nonetheless. Originally the rope around Twinn's waist was going to be a super long tail, but I thought that would be too cumbersome for a character to have. Also it is fun to make normal humans too, sometimes. Normal humans doing normal things, yup. For the ocean sparkles I used the \"Spray Brush Tool\" in Flash. I am liking it quite a bit, as it allows me to add small details like this without killing my wrist. I used the same tool to splatter the stars in the background for my previous deviation. Twinn's bangs keep reminding me of Ritsu. Made in Flash EDIT: not enough people are telling me that she looks like Edward Elric EDIT2: Please do not tell me she looks like Edward Elric.

Then the mayor was like \u201CDudes, you can\u2019t keep obstructing traffic like this,\u201D and the militia head was like \u201CCome on, man, the old mayor was cool with it,\u201D and the mayor was like \u201CNo,\u201D and so there was much weeping and hugging and the Block Parade was disbanded. That is, all but three. Millet Flauer (member #14) was on a school trip at the time and did not get notice of the dissolution. Her absence didn't make it any less official, but she was upset enough upon her return that she was determined to hold on to the Block Parade and restore it to its former glory. It has been 8 years since then, and net growth has been 0%. Good job. Oh yeah, she also carries a ceremonial sword around with her, given to her under the table by the former head of the Block Parade with his blessings. Barley Masche (member #2) technically has seniority over Millet, but ceded leadership to her because he would rather follow than lead. The Block Parade is funded by donations, only accepted in pennies. Barley carries these funds in a water jug, to remind himself of the weight of the people's support, and also because he really likes metal money. Back when the militia was at its peak, it was rumored that he slept on a hoard of coinage. Rye Wisquey (member #95) stuck around because he believed in the Block Parade and what it stood for. But then he got a job and he left. Shortly after, however, his son Malt \u201Cthe Kid\u201D (member #101) enlisted. Malt is a very quiet boy, always watching and listening, trying to learn what is happening around him. Frankly, he is scared of Millet, but tries not to show it because it would just give her more power over him. Barley\u2019s cool, though. He pays for his drinks. Postscript: it should be noted that in addition to the mayor, punk citizens also protested the actions of the Block Parade, insisting that it was totally wrong to beat up people in the name of peace because they have spiky hair. The Parade then went through 28 amendments of their mission statement until they settled on beating up hoodlums indiscriminately. <\/story> So in this one, I am trying a bolder approach to lines and color: mainly with bold lines and bold colors. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s supposed to be called, but I will call the thick dark shadows \u201Cmanga shading.\u201D I\u2019m trying to go for a more visual impact in this and embracing a more exaggerated style. Palette-wise, I tried to use a lot of saturation and yellow\/magenta\/cyan. All in all, it was refreshing to move away from the duller, darker palettes. The other sort of new thing I tried in this piece was to start off the sketch with silhouettes instead of skeletons. I think I might try doing it like this from now on, so the character is more defined by their shape than by a generic anatomy with smaller shapes tacked on to them. And then I will try to match it to a proper skeleton afterwards.

Sometimes she is simply satisfied to see her victim's death. Other times, however, she is more vampiric, draining her victims' blood or \"life force\". She occasionally takes on a succubus-like manner, preying on weak-willed men in order to drain or freeze them through sex or a kiss. Like the snow and winter weather she represents, Yuki-onna has a softer side. She sometimes lets would-be victims go for various reasons. In one popular Yuki-onna legend, for example, she sets a young boy free due to his beauty and age. She makes him promise to never mention her again, though, and when he relates the story to his wife much later in life, his wife reveals herself to be none other than the snow woman. She reviles him for breaking his promise but spares him yet again, this time out of concern for the children she has born him (but if he dares mistreat their children, she will return with no mercy.

In my opinion, Lolies (lolitas) r pretty little yound girls at the age of 9-15. if u ask what the characteristics of lolies are. i would say, they r just so young and so cute to make others wanna hug n protect them. they mustn't have big n sexy chest or hips. they may have long legs, but not in a sexy shape XD they have small round face whit big watery eyes n a small nose(sometimes they even don't have nose~)=w= sorry but a girl with a long nose or a long head like a rugby can not be count as a loli... 0_0 , however pretty she is, she's only can be call \" a pretty gilr\" but not a \"loli' em.. that's i can think of XD thx for the reading, if u r interested in Lolitas or the Original Loli Art Contest, welcome to our club~XD","medium":null,"title":"Yukin Melody ZiyoLing Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings","url":"https:\/\/ziyoling.deviantart.com\/art\/Yukin-Melody-90908574\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"YukinMelodyZiyoLingWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/ziyoling.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/f01d\/f\/2008\/189\/b\/2\/yukin_melody_by_sash0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Red"],"artist":"HyaKkiDouR4n","description":"EDIT (18\/05\/2017) - Replaced by new version of the picture, old one is available here : fav.me\/db9l13e As some of my older and most popular drawings, my Goddesses characters are one of my small successes. However as I believe they do not reflect my current style or ability, I have replaced them with their remade and improved versions from 2016-2017. I wish those drawings and characters to be showcase of what I can do now. Even though most people agree the new versions are major improvements, some still prefer the older versions, so I made those available as \"scraps\". The link above allows easy access. Thanks to everyone who has shown some support to my art. I hope this update will be in everyone's best interest. ------------------------------------ Original post : Character design for my game project with Among the many fragment of the great Void, there was one who loved to be bathed in light. This fragment was happy not being void anymore, and he wanted to make all the other fragments of the void feel how it felt at that time. The fragment asked Lutecia : \"O, almighty one who shaterred the Void with your golden wings! I want to share your beauty with the world! I want to fill all my void with your magnificent light! Please! Allow me to become your servant! Allow me to be a little light by the side of your sun!\" Lutecia had a peaceful smile, and gently answered: \"You are kind. But I don't want anyone else to carry such a burden as mine. You don't seem to realize, that all the Void isn't like you. Void doesn't want to bathe in light. It is my crime to have forced Void to know light. I don't want you to know the weight of this sin.\" In front of Lutecia's denial, the fragment became full of rage. What is more terrible than getting scolded for wanting the good? With time, its rage became more and more violent. And soon, the fragment transformed. But it didn't took the shape of a Goddess, as it should have. Instead, the fragment transformed into a beast. An invincible dragon that could spit something nobody ever saw in this world. It was a force made of rage. A destructive force. The force of fire. The fire was so powerful, that even Lutecia and Lilith, the two mightiest Goddesses, were powerless in front of the beast. And the beast claimed once again its demands : \"I want to be light! I want to bring warmth and peace to the void!\" In order to save creation from the beast, Lutecia soon decided to obey its demands. To calm the savage beast, she casted a magic charm on it, by giving it a peaceful and tender kiss on the forehead. Throught this charm, she gave the fragment what it desired : a fragment of light. The fragment now could give light and warmth. The new force it created, the fire, became a vector of Lutecia's beauty. The fragment calmed. It could finally exist for the purpose it desired since day one. Peacefully, it then transformed to what it was supposed to be : a new Goddess of Life. A new force of nature. This goddess was the light of life, desire, and passion. She was the wild light that completes Lutecia's serene light. She was soon considered as the most beautiful of all Goddesses. The \"dancing beauty\", as her name \"Faera\" means in Goddess language. But the beauty remains a mask for the beast she is and will always be. When angered, Faera magically transforms back into her original form, the form of an allmighty and furious dragon. The beast. In her woman form, she has a tail that reminds all living creatures of her destructive birth and her obliterating power that could end the whole world. Because of this, neither humans or Goddesses could ever tell if Faera was good or evil. She is two entities : a dancing beauty that gives warmth when light is missing, but also a fiery monster that can destroy anything in her path. She is just... fire. Is it me, or are the stories just getting longer each time? I'm on fire! (haha, joke.)

So at some point it might have gotten in the way of heroics and Jotaro would have been the first to stick his nose in that. A problem not even Star Platinum could solve. Still, hair care is very important. It's like a shirt you have to put on every day, so, you wouldn't choose a walmart shirt for that or sew your own. Unless you don't have a choice or are really good at making shirts I guess... Still, get yourselves a good one. This cover is from a 1971 cover for an anti-drugs Green Lantern\/Green Arrow story where Speedy turns out is addicted to heroin. If you have seen the show Arrow, they sort of handled this story. First with Speedy, who in the show is Green Arrow's sister, being a teen drug user and later with Roy who becomes the Red Arrow having unwillingly injected the \"Miracuru\" drug, which was a plot device in season 2. Remember when Arrow was good? I mean, it wasn't super good, but it was a lot of fun. Now people try to recall season 2 being superb, but back then everyone hated drunk Laurel and the Sebastian Blood plotline went nowhere. I've heard comments about season 5 being as good as season 1, but it was just a retread of that season which we already saw and was much better with Slade around and a villain that made sense. Arrow's studio is just a few blocks from my house... I keep hoping to bump into Willa Holland... but anyway! And remember kids, winners don't use drugs, not even caffeine or prescriptions apparently.

I chosen colors with my dad and I started to draw this drawing 3 months ago (I started to draw it on my laptop), but I never finished it...now I finally did. It was so hard to draw all these details in background and leaves. His name is Kenai and he's a young boy who dreams to become a leader and a warrior. He lives in town where lives all people with special gifts, like he has...and this are wings. He love to fly, but the problem is that he's not that good to become a great warrior. One day he left the town to show people that they are wrong and that he's talented as they are. But there were a problems on his trip...he was kidnapped by other warriors. They gave him into prison, but then he was released by nice warrior who hidden him at his home, so everyone thought that he has escaped...and he learned Kenai to fly. Kenai returned back to his town, but there was a war...he decided to help people in his town, but everyone told him that he must stop, because he would die. He didn't listen to them, and at the end of the day he killed the evil leader, and that's how he became a new leader and a warrior. Other info: He have short brown-orange hair and brown eyes. He have white wings and mostly he wears jackets, boots and long trousers. He likes accessories too. Adobe Photoshop CS5 tablet Genius G-pen M609X original size is 4493 x 6100 px I had 67 layers I drew this 18 hours Work in progress print screen you can see here. Details from this drawing you can see here. Detail from the sketch you can see here. I hope you like it and comments are welcome EDIT: And I changed a few things on this drawing, but not that much. Now I drew him a little \"secret\" smile, because he was to much serious before...and I made his head and hand smaller. If you want to see differences between drawing before and this one, you can see it here. I hope he looks better now and I needed one hour to fix everything.

I'll keep drawing her and introducing her friends, although I don't know if that often xD. And her story, as I'm gonna resume, it's completely different from Noa's life (my first OC)[Noa will appear later in another novel, visual novel maybe]. I really, really hope you'll like her and I'll write little by little her life. Gyssel: She's a happy, kind and talented girl. She doesn't doubt when it comes to help people in need, but she's not naive, knows how to know people's true colors. If a person is \"bad\", she will wear an assassin face and will say \"back off\". She was the little from a family of four, her parents and older sister, Noa. In a strange accident, her parents vanished... At that time Gyssel was 5, and Noa was 12, so she and her sister were taken to a girls orphanage of the church. After a couple of years, her sister asked Gyssel to behave well and be a good girl, and someday someone, without a doubt will adopt her. And suddenly, her sister left Gyssel behind with a broken heart and tears. One day a married couple came to the orphange. The married couple loved the cute little Gyssel. Her future adoptive mother hugged her and kissed her when Gyssel told her about her sister. Her future adoptive mother told gyssel that she and her sister will see each other again, that the meaning of Noa's memento, which Noa left on Gyssel's bed, was \"Hearts are always together\". So they will always be together. Then, Gyssel was happy with her new family, and never forgot about her sister (which she later would search after...) Thanks to her adoptive father, who was a boxer, Gyssel learned kickboxing. And thanks to her adoptive mother, who was a excellent composer for movies music, Gyssel became very skilled for music. Now, she's a composer for a pop singer. And she also helps a lot of heavy\/metal\/rock bands, so she's pretty famous in the music world. One day, a band asked her to help them in a event, and that event was in Germany... -------------- If you like my art, please, follow me: www.facebook.com\/asterDAbeast\/ twitter.com\/Aster_Crowley","medium":null,"title":"Gyssel Ainsley OC AsterCrowley Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings AsterCrowley #beautifulgirl #glassesgirl #leotard #musicgirl #originalcharacter #sideboob","url":"https:\/\/astercrowley.deviantart.com\/art\/Gyssel-Ainsley-OC-696487314\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"GysselAinsleyOCAsterCrowleyWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsAsterCrowleybeautifulgirlglassesgirlleotardmusicgirloriginalcharactersideboobimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/astercrowley.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/c1dd\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/214\/e\/d\/gyssel_ainsley_oc_by_astercrowley-dbio51u.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Yellow"],"artist":"gem2niki","description":"Happy Chinese New Year!!

YAY!! A scene from Forgotten Journy x3 Which I LOVE! Himikea kneels on the Holy Spiring, thanksing Weyards for everything x3 So niiiiiiiice! After writing it I had to draw it Background was overkill... x_X lol But I guess it was worth it... YAY! SHINY!!! <-I like shiny lately... lol DON'T tell me things like 'Huh? That girl sits ON the water! She should be sinking you n00b!\" Read the passage and you will see that she sits ON the surface She's a half-spirit for goodness's sake! (Friend of mine complained about that xD) Anyway: This picture, Essence of Time, Himikea and Weyards (c) Lineart: For those interested: The passage from Chapter 39 of Essence of Time: The Forgotten Journey Enjoy~ In the depths of the elven forest, light shone through the roof of the temple of plants... The giant dragon that guarded Weyards lay on his usual spot in front of the altar, holding a nap. Himikea stepped into the sacred place she had spent the most time of her life, folding her hands in front of her chest. The leaf-like hair fell around her shoulders in wild strains and her furry ears flapped slightly in the light. \"Lord Wey- I mean... Lord Vega, may I talk with the Great Spirit of Plants for a second?\" She lay her hand on the giant creature's yaw, stroking over it with dreamdazed eyes. It felt strange not to see the mighty dragon as ruler of the forest anymore... All elves and even she herself had lived in the believe the mighty creature was the one they worshipped... but instead it was the most fragile of beings... \"...\" The dragon worm rose his head, shaking it sleepily. \"Lady Weyards wants to enjoy her half-awakened state. She is at the holy spring behind the temple.\" \"Thank you.\" The green-haired woman smiled and walked past the guardian towards a hidden hallway that brought her outside again... She loved this place... and she would miss it dearly... From afar, her keen ears already heard the soft voice of the Great Spirit of Plants, singing a soft tune. After pushing a few branches aside, Himikea finally found the gracious fairy-spirit. With her tiny feet, she hopped over the water-surface, sending tiny waves over the water that reflected in the sun like rings of pure light. \"Oh, it is you!\" Weyards smiled shyly, floating in midair. Her deep dark eyes focused he giant woman in front of her... On the other hand, compared to her, anything was giant... \"So, you are leaving your bed from time to time now?\" Himikea replied gently before walking past the stones around the pond, and sitting down on the watersurface as if it was blue glass... \"My might hasn't been unsealed yet, but at least I awoke from my unnatural rest.\" The fairy smiled, floating back a little more. She looked up at the green haired person in front of her, a feeling of sadness entering her chest... \"I'm so sorry...\" \"For what, Milady?\" Himikea blinked shocked. \"You aren't responsible for anything that has happened or that will happen! I lived long enough, outlived most of my friends and now, my life is given a meaning.\" She smiled and offered Weyards her hand. \"I have to thank you for choosing me. For giving me the power of nature and to allowing me to see your true face at last. You listened to my call even though you didn't had to.\" \"But I am not what anyone expects me to be... A protector of all nature should be mighty and full of grace and... look at me, I have to pretend I am someone else just so people won't harm me... For me this little spring is giant! For you it must appear like a puddle...\" \"Hehe, yes, but Holy Puddle wouldn't sound so nice, right?\" The greenhaired woman knelt forward a little more, looking deep into the spirit's eyes... \"Look around you, Lady Weyards... All these plants around us... every single tree, even the Holy Elven Tree my people live in, once were little seeds. When looking at them, we only see the might and strength of them as they stand in full glory in front of us, but to grow this tall, the seed itself needs to inhabit the strength and will to grow this tall... Everything we worship begins with the smallest of things, the seed... So you only remind me of something I myself have forgotten: Life starts with a small seed. If we ignore it and let it die, there won't be any giant trees in the future. So, I want to thank you, for being the beginning of it all...\"","medium":null,"title":"Natural Spirits Dea-89 Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings Dea-89","url":"https:\/\/dea-89.deviantart.com\/art\/Natural-Spirits-153567274\/?purchase=print&itemids=182","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"NaturalSpiritsDea89WatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsDea89image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$109.50","artistURL":"https:\/\/dea-89.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/7be5\/i\/2013\/249\/3\/d\/natural_spirits_by_deamond89-d2jfh9m.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Green"],"artist":"plamt","description":"wowwww Finally I've finished this =.='' 6 months .......... for this pic OTL .....

We have many friends, Masa, despite what you think.\" \"Friends?\" the mercenary scoffed. \"Really? Like who?\" Munryeo frowned and paused in his fussing to level Masa with an unimpressed look. \"The Queen, for starters.\" \"She had us thrown in jail,\" Masa objected. \"And let's not forget the warrant she currently has out for our arrest.\" Munryeo shook his head and turned back to his gift. \"Yes, well, you do insist on antagonising her. Tobias?\" \"He's your childhood friend, not mine. Last time we met I slapped him in the face.\" \"Masa!\" \"Oh, didn't you know about that..?\" \"Good grief, no wonder he was hesitant when I said we'd be visiting,\" the priest muttered under his breath. Brightly coloured paper crumpled in his hands. \"Okay then, Narwyn.\" Masa stood from his reclined position with a sigh. \"He's seen more of you naked than I have. I don't like him.\" \"Heavens...! Masa!\" The mercenary gave a casual shrug. \"What?\" Munryeo buried his face in his hands and sunk into the plush sofa. He felt the cushions dip and peered through his fingers to see Masa slide down beside him, pressing their shoulders together and gently removing the traces of paper and ribbon from his lap. He shot the mercenary a dirty look. \"You're incorrigible.\" \"It's been said,\" Masa smiled, unconcerned. \"But you wouldn't have me any other way.\" Munryeo snorted and turned back to his presents. He could feel his partner's gaze on him but couldn't bring himself to meet it, suddenly aware of the thick silence, the warmth. His fingers fiddled with the loose end of a ribbon, folding and curling, twisting. \"You do though, you know.\" Masa's voice seemed to come from far away and when Munryeo finally looked over he saw the mercenary's gaze was distant. A heavy weight settled over his hand and Munryeo grasped it without thinking. \"Have me, I mean,\" Masa continued, still looking only at the flames dancing in the fireplace. Munryeo glanced down at the hand folded over his, the warmth that contrasted so wildly with the chill of his own skin. \"I do,\" he answered slowly. \"And it's enough.\" ------------------------ My babies. *sobs* I want to congratulate myself on getting this up before Christmas but we all know better, don't we?

After reading all of the available information on the character, I was a little confused about what to do with her. Obviously, very cool looking, but as a mostly American comic fan, the story synopses I could find were pretty unintelligible. Luckily I got a great trainee in this week's class and she boiled it right down for me: It's the Headless Horseman. Don't know what it was about that that put things together for me, but there it is.

Yes! more homework, from a halloween flavored assignment in my intro to illustration class. We were assigned the imaginary task of designing street banners for the city of minneapolis, springboarding from a shakespearian quote ripe with spooky undertones and chills. For our choosing we had two from Macbeth, and one that was just labeled \"shakespear\". I picked the one about all stuff going into a \"hellbroth\" from Macbeth, and thus the thumbnails began a flurry of sorcery and crazy looking witches twisting sinuously around a cauldron and what have you. Some involved the cauldron chasing the ingredients, which were delightfully silly. That said, I honestly have no idea how the hell this idea happened. A lot of the thumbnails, like i said, had to do with the witches tossing monsterous creatures into the witchpot.

Had to postpone Rennaissance for this week and other titles I'm working on. BUT! Since Halloween is just around the corner, I offer this ichiruki Fanart. It's not scary or halloween-y type but I decided I wanted a steampunk theme, since I haven't tried it AT ALL. And frankly, I think it suits ichigo and rukia nicely. What do you think? I had fun creating ichigo and rukia's costumes. The background was fun and challenging but great pain! 0_- A little script I made for this artwork. Sighing as he got off the steam-powered train, the young man with orange colored hair wiped his brow and dusted his head. It was a long night, but he's glad to be able to set foot on land and sniff the steam around him. Ahh. Home sweet home. He paced his way towards the direction he always remembered inside his head, the grin on his face never leaving as he strode each alley and corners. Sweat trickled down his forehead to his chin and the smog kissing his face. At last he arrived at his destination, slammed the door open and dropped his bag on the workshop table. He smiled sexily at the woman in front of him--who doesn't even seem to notice that he's home and just right behind her. He took this opportunity to grab her--earning a squeak from the raven haired girl--then placing her on top of the table she is working on. \"I-ICHIGO!!\" \"Tadaima, Rukia.\" Ichigo decided he won't berate her for being so focused in work to not notice him. He just wanted to kiss her senseless and make her know how much he missed her in the week he's been away. \"Ichigo you're a mess--\" Took her breath away that's what. And frankly, she doesn't care. In between hot kisses and heavy groping, they made known how much they longed each other. <\/b> That's it. not literature material but hey! XD Hope you enjoy this As i too enjoyed making this.

Her woman neighbours gave her a nick-name \"Black widow\", because she is beautiful from the outside, but her soul is awful, and she cares only about money...she would even kill for it. She always look for her next victim and even that sometimes family by her next husband sees what is she like...mothers try to warn her sons from her, but it's abandon all hope.

Savannah and Larissa are twins, but they are absolutely different. Savanna have tan skin and green eyes, she is open hearted and motherly, while Larissa is silent and restrained, she have pale skin and brown eyes. So I decided to draw them as personalizations of Love (Savanna) and Pain (Larissa), cuz love and pain definitely are twins in the Attack on Titans world and always come together. Besides that the dearest and closest people are those who can hurt us most strongly, and I believe such different sisters in such a cruel world probably have not easy road and relationships.

Like Elysa (his female predecessor) he wasn't born as a god either. He was just born as a normal boy with a pretty frail body, but a strong mind that made him able to control more energy than any other person of his age would be able to. Because of that power and the disorders that came with it, he was despised and looked down upon by the entire human race. But he managed to take his life in his own hands, and finally make something of it. Until the bomb dropped, that wiped his beloved ones away and ripped his life completely apart. Desperately and heartbroken as he was, he decided to use his powers to shut down his human emotions permanently, and get rid of the pain. This was the key to gain control of the power that is referred to as the godly 8th element. Unlike Elysa, Anima did not eliminate people out of anger or revenge. His attempts for destroying the world are just out of curiosity: seeing how far he could go without getting interfered. ~ Weird music that inspired me: [link] [link] ~ Features: [link] [link] [link] [link] [link] Newer version:","medium":null,"title":"ANIMA - No human soul DamaiMikaz Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings","url":"https:\/\/damaimikaz.deviantart.com\/art\/ANIMA-No-human-soul-169584810\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"ANIMANohumansoulDamaiMikazWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/damaimikaz.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/ae79\/th\/pre\/i\/2010\/181\/2\/2\/anima___no_human_soul_by_damaimikaz.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"MediaViolence","description":"High seas free bird!

But I think it was all worth it in the end. I altered the lineart quite a few times with my tablet, I dare you to pick the tablet-drawn parts out from the traditionally inked parts. HA! Anyway, the basic idea of this was something I wanted to do for a while now: Lucifer pulling a Bob Fosse-esque dance move\/pose (though a cane is more of a Chaplin thing, isn't it?) and I think that was successful (if you want to know why you should think Bob Fosse is totally awesome watch the best coma dream EVER from the film \"All That Jazz\". It's a dance number, you plebians. This one is good too, and isn't all abstract and fanciful.) Then I got the notion to use a limited palette and an abundance of red, even though I associate Lucifer more with black, grey and blue than I do red. And then all that abstract nonsense came about, it took me a long long time to come up with a background I liked, seriously. I had half a mind to just leave it blank but that seemed a little boring. Overall I'm pleased with how this came out. Originally his wings were going to have red, slightly glowing blood splotches on them but they looked so damn good solid I left them that way. Ha ha you can't see his face.. partially because I'm not totally done with his plastic surgery, so to speak, and hats are a tell-tale Fosse thing (although he should probably be wearing gloves as well, amirite?) The about three older people who watch me will probably be amused by me being a fangirl of a film\/choreographer that was before my time and I've probably alienated my younger audience. Just look at the pretty colors~! While working on this I was listening to the Cell Block Tango of all things alot (well Fosse did choreograph the original stage production, and its a catchy song), as well as The Days of Swine and Roses (which is a song that makes me draw Lucifer and Azrael alot) and retardedly: Marilyn Manson's cover of \"This is Halloween\", which even though I don't really like Marilyn Manson I can't help but love the funkitude of that cover.

Tsukiboshi: literally \"Moon Star\" (or, if you try reading the title top-down & right-to-left, it is Kishitsubo: \"Coast Jar\"?) About the Characters \/ Backstory: Daymoon and Noonstar are a pair of twins (hopefully I don't need to point out who is who). Daymoon can become the sickle blade Waratsuki (\"Smiling Moon\"), while Noonstar can become the pistol \"Shooting Star.\" They come from Weapon Planet where everyone can do this, so it's nothing special. Anyhow, these twin sisters are mid-ranking officers of the Galaxy Police, where they travel between worlds in an effort to promote peace through violence. Violence against Violence, that is! Two wrongs make a right, just like in signed multiplication and personal vengeance. They enlisted following in the footsteps of their father, who though having made no outstanding accomplishments still remains a great source of inspiration for his daughters. Development History Originally the twins were just one older character who I eventually discarded for the following reasons: 1) Though she was supposed to be 40, I kept drawing her like she was 20. This will take some time to learn. 2) Twins seemed like a cool idea. A pair of sisters that can turn into weapons and wield each other? Surely it has never been done! Daymoon's design is Western themed and is partly the fruits of my unsatisfied desire to couple a hat with a jacket draped over the shoulders. I would probably buy a hat and a coat and try it myself if it were appropriate for southern California weather. Noonstar's design is Eastern themed and is inspired by a song from THE iDOLM@STER which includes the phrases \"Shooting Star\" (gun form) and \"Blue Bird\" (feathers on cloak) in the refrain. Her hat was originally a golden brown color, but I have a habit of always coloring those types of hats brown, so I decided to try for a black metallic appearance. The big red ribbon around both of their necks is to emphasize their twin-ness (apparently identical faces is not enough, because that is the case in a vast majority of anime). I would normally be wary of giant ribbons, but Pandora Hearts seemed to pull it off well enough with Alice. Comments as an Artist I remember now why I don't like thin lines in Flash - THEY BREAK ALL THE TIME. If you saw this picture without the colors, you'd be confused by the dainty line-art where a single stroke appears to vanish in several places in the middle. Such a pain. I like Noonstar's face more than Daymoon's, even though I basically just traced the former off of the latter's. The background was fun to make. It's a bit busier than I would have preferred, but it was an excellent opportunity to play with dizzying perspectives. Still learning how to shade folds in clothing. One thing I've learned though is that a missing fold looks better than a fold in the wrong place. Learning to make that call is a different matter, though. I am also learning that sometimes 2 shades of color can look better than 3, if done correctly.

She was a lot of fun to draw so I would expect a lot of her The premium content is a full version in case you wanted to print at home or walmart or something Anyways, here is her info! I hope you like her ^_^ BIOGRAPHY NAME: Lydia AGE: Ageless EXPERIENCE LEVEL: 22 yrs RANK: Rank IV PARTNER: Morton (It is a girl though... ). It's Lydia's skull after all LIKES: Teasing Charlie, \"Haunting\", Gina's shows DISLIKES: Her hands, touching things, being corporeal, food CLOSEST RELATIONS: Kaori, Eleanor, Lynne, Himeko, Charlie ABOUT: Lydia is a very special R.I.N.G.S. Even though no R.I.N.G.S. actually ages (in the purest sense) she is actually dead and will never age. Not pseudo dead or kinda dead. No, she is dead-dead. She is, quite literally, a ghost. Aki had to make her special clothing due to this. The clothing is very similar to a ghosts ectoplasmic make up but she was not able to make it completely ghost like. This means her clothing cannot completely pass through things and, if enough resistive force is applied, Lydia can pass through her clothing. Lydia also speaks in a very monotone, straight-forward manner and sugar coats nothing. She is very blunt. Lydia really hates touching things. Since she can pass through things (like any self respecting ghost) the feel of corporeal objects is grotesque to her. Everything feels like a hairy and gelatinous snot to her. She is capable of touching things after using her first unlock but she does not like to do it since everything feels so gross. This is why she hates her hands. Hands are for touching so she opts to hide them. She is very much part of the team but, since she is a ghost, she is technically haunting the lab She does enjoy hiding (she is capable of making herself turn invisible but her clothing cannot) and then scaring people. Her favorite target is Charlie. He reacts perfectly. She does not like to be scared though and she is deadly afraid of being alone. So, she will be a total creeper and \"sleep\" in someones room without them knowing just to combat this.","medium":null,"title":"The Specter of the Lab Damaged927 Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings Damaged927","url":"https:\/\/damaged927.deviantart.com\/art\/The-Specter-of-the-Lab-438407113\/?purchase=print&itemids=19","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"TheSpecteroftheLabDamaged927WatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsDamaged927image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$31.19","artistURL":"https:\/\/damaged927.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/3160\/f\/2014\/064\/9\/8\/the_haunt_of_the_lab_da_by_damaged927-d790l3d.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Kazukoto","description":"Managed to crank this one out (hehe) early.

I dunno Whatever you'd like to behind that mountainous berm is what she called a strike on Okay, in reality I was just messing around Cloud Brushes by Fooblued and ended up with something kinda cool. So, I just rolled with it. Lydia, after all, is a spectral being who can vanish as she pleases. So, she is really really useful for espionage. Maybe she found a drug cartel or something and called in a strike. Maybe there was a rival corporation that was stealing Yamaarashi's intellectual property so she called it in to make them go away. Maybe it just looked really cool and I kept it She's also a wallpaper if anyone is interested ^_^ The sizes available in the zip file are: 1920x1200 1440x900 1280x800 1600x1200 1280x960 1024x768 Also, if you want to know about the story she comes from you can get the first volume here I hope you like her!

The series revolves around a pair of laywers: Millie Pluck (left) and her partner Barotrim Strumm (a.k.a. Old Man Strumm). The two of them go on legal escapades and don't make a lot of money, sometimes due to losing important documents and\/or people. Millie has the rare ability to read and understand end-user license agreements in the amount of time it takes for a normal person to agree to ten of them. It has yet to prove itself to be an awesome asset, but she holds on to it as her trump card. Aside from that, she's a quick thinker and resilient in court, making her a non-trivial opponent. She met Barotrim when she graduated from law school and sued him for hitting her with his car in the parking lot. Barotrim, on the other hand, possesses no exceptional talent but has a solid grasp of a wide spectrum of law. He is a hefty man in his late 40's and assists Millie in preparation for cases. He has a family of his own and his kids are good friends with Millie, who has been somewhat integrated into the family. He first met Millie at her school parking lot where he almost ran over her while slightly not sober. Anyhow, this deviation marks the first time I've tried that weird technique some people do where they kind of glow or blur the lineart and make the picture look \"softer.\" I've also tried another method of line colors using subtraction, but I don't know how to explain it or if anyone actually cares. It's subtle, but it's cool! And I like it! Originally I thought Millie would be a solo lawyer who chased software pirates. But then I didn't know if lawyers did that and how they would go about doing that. Plus it seemed so very futile, so in the end up I settled for a vague category of \"legal escapades.\" She also used to be holding a kitchen knife in her first design. Made in Flash EDIT: fixed the ã? in the title and after some feedback, toned down the glow a bit and shortened Millie's arm. Also, KASOGATE is just a fake company I made up so I could put its name on a building. I suppose they make semiconductors. EDIT2: I did a poor job of this, but Millie is not just Apollo Justice as a girl in a different colored suit. Her work does not involve magic or murder.","medium":null,"title":"Ganbare Bengoshi-san JohnSu Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings JohnSu","url":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/art\/Ganbare-Bengoshi-san-110093307\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"GanbareBengoshisanJohnSuWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsJohnSuimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/johnsu.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/727c\/th\/pre\/f\/2009\/020\/3\/8\/ganbare_bengoshi_san_by_johnsu.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"nelsonsartworks","description":"Christmas drawing~ though a little late It took more time than I originally thought","medium":null,"title":"Christmas Gift nelsonsartworks Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Drawings nelsonsartworks #anime #chirstmas #christmaslights #clothes #digitalart #flowers #gift #girl #glow #hat #lamps #light #lightbulbs #plants #red #santa #sketchbook #sky #white #xmas (show more)","url":"https:\/\/nelsonsartworks.deviantart.com\/art\/Christmas-Gift-722012941\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Drawings"],"filename":"ChristmasGiftnelsonsartworksWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaDrawingsnelsonsartworksanimechirstmaschristmaslightsclothesdigitalartflowersgiftgirlglowhatlampslightlightbulbsplantsredsantasketchbookskywhitexmasshowmoreimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/nelsonsartworks.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/ff9c\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/360\/3\/c\/christmas_gift_by_nelsonsartworks-dbxv8r1.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," White"],"artist":"ComiPa","description":"From H.M.O Hatsune Miku Orchestra been listening to the song for almost a week now...

The other dwarves are constantly on her case about not using her skills for the good of her people, but she's like \"No. I am Robo Princess,\" and then locks herself in a volcano with her creations. Her father the King is very concerned and often tries to convince her to get married or to get a \"real job.\" He's even tried to get her mentor to talk some sense into her, but Hephaestus doesn't care - he thinks it's cool. Though it would probably be even cooler if she would produce some work from Evangelion or Gurren Lagann some time, too, since those are some pretty hip designs.

Hence I cropped the image and left it as such. The armor (or lack thereof) is a traditional Sarashi and Hakama which Erza adorns during her battle against Ikaruga. I loved the animation during this saga of the anime, and that's the reason I drew it. Technical Specs Used 2H for the inital rough sketch Used 4B and 6B for the shading, and a tortillion set to mix it up. Not to forget, Copic Multiliner 0.3 for the outlines. The glow on the sword was done by eraser, but the plan was beforehand. The technique of the graininess of the shading part was partly my paper's fault, but I like this type of shading, so I gave no thought of further smoothening it out. Hope you guys like this!

This time I will be rather glad to hear that XDD. It's because originally Hypnos is a very girlish character, calm, sensitive, and very cute- just the uke type : p .

Anyway, other than that, I'm really proud of this one, it's been a long time since I've made a fanart piece, I'm always so afraid I won't capture the character, but I think I did pretty well here. The \"gem,\" I think that's what it is, on Zero's helmet I feel came out really dimensional, and everything came out really vibrant. I also wanted to try more on the background so I referenced some of the backgrounds in game to create the futuristic city behind them. Those clouds man! Anyway, I'm really proud of this piece, and I hope you all like it! You guys let me know what you think and if you're interested in getting a commission, my prices are linked below. Commissions (Raising Money for College) Well, it's that time again, I've got to get money together to help pay for tuition, books, etc. Honestly, this may be the last semester where I can have prices this low, I'm trying to transfer next semester to a bigger more art focused college, so I may have to raise prices in a few months.

I've had this idea in mind for quite a while now, but until today I hadn't taken the opportunity to put it on screen. Anyhow, shall I explain who this maiden is? I shall! I shall! So this here is my Flash mascot. One of the things I say so often at the end of my deviations is \"Made in Flash,\" so this deviation can be taken as an allusion to that. There's going to be some confusion now, as there's a maiden named Flash and a program also called Flash, so for this deviation I'll be referring to the girl as \"Flash\" and the program as Adobe Flash. \"Flash\" is the personification of Adobe Flash, designed to incorporate a number of references to the program: in her hair are the Selection Tool and the Sub-selection tool, in her hand is the paint brush tool (with a pressure sensitive tip on the other end), on her apron is a folder for containing layers, on the bottom of her apron is a row of keyframes, on her stomach is the playhead for the timeline, and over her right eye she wears the shockwave emblem. And we'll say she keeps everything I've forgotten in her apron folder. Also, she knows how to speak in three Actionscripts. The flowers in this picture are based loosely off of peach blossoms, not for any particular reason. The fact that she's wearing an eyepatch is testament to the fact that you can only use one mouse button in swf's. Or maybe it's another reason. This picture took me pretty much the whole day, from morning to night. Gurgggghh, so tired. And I don't think I can sell this as a print, since it contains symbols owned by Adobe.

The Goblun (jumping fellow in the center) is an artificial soldier made of wood, cloth, and rabbit organs. It was crafted by Likli Jacker (lass on the crab-thing) as a fuel efficient alternative to their regular human soldiers and assigned as a personal guard to the princess. However, a faulty array index in the Goblun's firmware resulted in \"Protect target\" being replaced with \"Crush target.\" Since no threat has yet come to the princess, this command hasn't had a chance to be executed. Likli tried to update the Goblun, but it hit her in self defense and ran away. Now it's a race between Likli and disaster to see who can catch the Goblun. Originally I was going to cel-shade this piece, but once I got the gradient coloring in, I felt I couldn't bear to color it any other way. It took quite a while, but it was a fun experience and I'm liking the soft feel of it. Radial gradients are my friend. The Goblun's design originally had tendrils\/tentacles for arms. I have no idea why I did that. But eventually trying to find matching colors for it became such a problem that I scrapped them and gave him arms. As for his legs, they're based off of a meat tenderizer in my kitchen.

Here you can see what she is really doing after she has left School and her friends. She has become a student of archaeology. Please take a look here fav.me\/d63ueoy for more informations about her time in school. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Directly after school she started to study archaeology with the private teachers at home. After getting the basics down, a teacher from her former high school became her mentor. Skie was so smart and very inquisitive she managed to be his leading assistant in no time. Together they traveled to various excavation sites, and for the first time in her life Skie was feeling some sort of freedom in her life. Skie was having a lot of fun traveling around the world with her mentor. During this time she also managed to stay in contact with her friends from her old school. The secret meeting place was the Stripclub. So Skie works there on her free time away from studying. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, this picture isn't showing so much skin as usual. But that have a reason: As the subtitle \"I am more than just Boobs with a Butt\" suggests, the massage hiding in the picture is something different and difficult to explain this time. With her finger pointing to her Head I want to let Skie say something like \"I know how to use my head, too!\" Sure, Skie's Cleavage and Pose might be sexy again. But with a small wink of her finger she shows that there is even more inside her. And I hope that shows that Skie really is more than just Boobs and a Butt...not only for me as her creator but also for a few fans out there who are interessted in her story. What I want to say for a real life situation is that there is always more behind a person. So treat everyone with proper respect and don't let the \"First Impression\" control your opinion. A busty stripper in a nightclub could also be a student of archeology in real life. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Possible Videogame-Idea Mostly like a classical Tomb Raider-Clone. But with less action parts and more focus on riddles (complex like a Point\u2019n Click Adventure) and Jump\u2019n Run. The atmosphere in the game should give the feeling of a documentary about Ruins and Animals (like \"Endless Ocean\" on the Wii) Since Skie don't like to fight it would also be more sneaking involved and to avoid encounters. Animals, like in real life, mostly will not attack her. And they would only attack when they are trapped. So Skie need to free Animals or to scare them off with a whip. She knows how to use it because of the gymnastic band from her training in school. Also the whip is quite comfortable for the Jump\u2019n Run part of the game. The Story could be about finding more Crystals like the one she had found in the School and about her secret relationship with her friends and the Stripclub. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Special Thanks goes to MasterSaruwatari for helping me with the description again. I also want to give a big thanks to Elythe and Bustgoddess Without the critiques and the help from these two girls this picture would be possible. I have used a photo as a help for the pose Skie is doing. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wallpaper-Edition #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- www.patreon.com\/skiemaree Alice \"Skie\" Maree Â© Skie-Maree (Oliver Scheppank) | Artwork by Skie-Maree (Oliver Scheppank) More informations about Skie can be found here!","medium":null,"title":"A Smart Girl Skie-Maree Watch Manga & Anime Digital Media Paintings Skie-Maree","url":"https:\/\/skie-maree.deviantart.com\/art\/A-Smart-Girl-370749904\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Manga & Anime","Digital Media","Paintings"],"filename":"ASmartGirlSkieMareeWatchMangaAnimeDigitalMediaPaintingsSkieMareeimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/skie-maree.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/e9a3\/f\/2013\/130\/6\/c\/a_smart_girl_by_skie_maree-d64qggg.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"zelda308","description":"Annnddd... my profile icon.

By the time the crew realized she was missing, it had already been several weeks (very negligent) and no one could remember when they had last seen her, so they're having a hard time of figuring out where to look. They might not even be trying, actually, since apparently nobody cared enough to notice she was missing for so long... *emo emo* So now she spend her days on this island as a leech on a pastoral community. The locals do their best to ignore her, but she keeps eating their ruined produce and trying to be part of everything. She is like the annoying kid sister of the island who somehow manages to thrive despite everyone's attempts to get her to leave. How they expect her to do that is a mystery, as there are no airships on the island. Perhaps they are just hoping that the pirates will come back one day and take her back with them. Good luck with that, everyone! But in spite of her unearned unpopularity, Arbalest does have one pretty cool specialty: she can throw an arrow pretty hard. Perhaps not as far or as accurately as her namesake can, but she could probably wreck a bird from a good distance. This ability is a secret, though. Because nobody pays attention when she's trying to show off. *emo emo* --- This is my first painted work in a long time (I don't count my previous submission as a \"paint\" job since it used pretty much the same techniques I used in Flash). The last time I tried digital painting was probably...six years ago? I like to imagine I've learned some things during my ventures in Flash and while envying *joodlez's work - namely, that separation of colors is important! Being able to blend colors shouldn't mean I blend all the colors. Otherwise I just get this muddy \/ noisy piece. Hopefully, moving forward I will continue to learn when to color sharp & flat, and when to color soft & smooth.

After growing up, now I see how harshly they are criticized as if most of them weren't very good (not just Liefeld). This one is based on a Jim Lee's cover for Batman, and while the guy has improved as an artist, his characters still look roughly the same and dear god, look at that torax, it could have it's own spinoff. Either way, about Batman, any thoughts on what to expect fof Justice League? I didn't like BvS at all (not even extended cut) and that Batman was terrible, but to be fair, movie Batmen are all really bad, they are just a crazy rich guy dressed like a bat and punching homeless and other people in need of professional help. He's supposed to be the greatest detective in the world, yet every movie he is mindblown by the dumbest plans his villains can come up with (where's rachel?!, where's the trigger?!, what's a Martha?!, why are there so may penguins???!), to the point that Val Kilmer's portrayal was the only one who did proper detective work and is ahead of the Riddler (how come his smartest foe is the only one who didn't outsmart him? and why am I praising Batman Forever?). I even expected Lego Batman to be better than live action Batman, but he was just as dumb. Anyway, we'll always have the Animated Series and the Arkham games now (just give a movie to Paul Dini and Bruce Timm...). And hey, say what you want about 60s Batman, but those riddles were damn hard. For commissions, send me a message through the page.
