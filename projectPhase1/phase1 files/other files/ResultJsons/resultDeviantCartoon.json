An artist needs to make art that's right for them, despite the noise. Make art time personal time and keep working, no matter what. This is not an anti-critique piece. Critique is good. Useful input is useful. It's up to the artist to decide what is and what isn't. It's about blocking out the kind of distraction and negativity that derails the artistic process. What artists need to worry about most is making their art and to not get involved in all the BS. Absorb all the valid feedback and let the rest just bounce off. Happy Christmas. Edit: Thank you for the DD! I'm glad so many people found it to be cheering to them. After getting some feedback, I'd like to elaborate a little bit on some of the thoughts I've had in response. The first is that these people are not necessarily 'bad guys'. They represent forces that often cause an artist to become upset, reactive, wasteful of energy. (I picked the ones I see people becoming the most upset about on DeviantART and on the internet in general. I personally have no problem with people who copy my work, but some people do). The artist is the filter and it is the artist who decides how these people hurt or help their ability to make art. There will always be trolls, haters, critics, copiers, feedback both good and bad, and the artist must always express themselves in spite of this, to take in what is useful to them, let the rest go, and not get caught up in their own negativity. This ideal artist is not at war with a hostile environment but at peace with reality. Secondly, I've made it into a print (as per requested) but am also allowing the full DL of the original drawing for anyone who wants to print it out and just hang it up in their work space as a little reminder.","medium":null,"title":"an artist's job is to make art hibbary Watch Cartoons & Comics Traditional Media Comics Other hibbary","url":"https:\/\/hibbary.deviantart.com\/art\/an-artist-s-job-is-to-make-art-190802413\/?purchase=print&itemids=83","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Traditional Media","Comics","Other"],"filename":"anartistsjobistomakearthibbaryWatchCartoonsComicsTraditionalMediaComicsOtherhibbaryimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/hibbary.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/0efc\/i\/2010\/365\/9\/3\/an_artist__s_job_is_to_make_art_by_hibbary-d35lk31.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"JohnathanSung","description":"the little mermaid aprox 45 mins to an hr, nothin too detailed, had to get this done before the day ended. its abit rough but i think it has potential. when u look at the ocean, u see its relentless, its bigger than us and it never stops, wave after wave endlessly changing, its restless.. frantic, turning, loud and scary at times, and grey and shite others, it can be cold or warm, its clear here and murky there, it can look red, green, purple, and black etc...etc.. and every now and then, it can be still, calm, nice, peaceful and beautiful, even though u know its going to change again soon..so all u can do is enjoy the moment, when ur in it. and while it lasts.

LOOK AWAY IF YOU HAVEN'T READ \"DARKNESS OF DRAGONS\"!!! --- Ok, I know a lot of people weren't happy with Peacemaker's origin but...I really couldn't see it going any other way. It was literally the only solution for a gigantic problem, and I am completely ok with it. Yes, like most of you I adored Darkstalker. He was a fantastic villain and a really likable yet despicable character. His problem was that he was literally so OP that no one could kill him, so changing him was really the only thing that could stop him. He was given the choice to redeem himself, but he refused. If he had accepted defeat and changed his ways then maybe we wouldn't have gotten Peacemaker, the polar opposite of the tyrant. But alas, our favourite stubborn ol' villain had to be enchanted into the form of a baby Night\/RainWing to prevent him from causing further damage to Pyyrhia. And for what we got, Peacemaker is pretty damn adorable. I know he was described as being a NightWing with rainbow-coloured sparkles instead of white, but I just loved the idea of giving him little RainWing frills because they looked cuter. Peacemaker is destined to live a wholesome, loving life and I wanted his design to reflect that. If you look closely you'll see that I also gave him rainbow eyes. I did, however, keep the white IceWing spikes that I like to give Darkstalker as a reminder of his past. I would also usually draw NightWings with black horns but in this case I thought it looked better to make them white to represent his IceWing heritage.","medium":null,"title":"Peacemaker Blaze-TFD Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings Blaze-TFD #darkness #darkstalker #dragon #dragonet #dragons #hope #moon #nightwing #peacemaker #rainwing #wings #wingsoffire #foeslayer #fire #moonwatcher #rising (show more)","url":"https:\/\/blaze-tfd.deviantart.com\/art\/Peacemaker-714891908\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"PeacemakerBlazeTFDWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsBlazeTFDdarknessdarkstalkerdragondragonetdragonshopemoonnightwingpeacemakerrainwingwingswingsoffirefoeslayerfiremoonwatcherrisingshowmoreimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/blaze-tfd.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/ec39\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/317\/5\/8\/peacemaker_by_blaze_tfd-dbtmm4k.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," White"],"artist":"GashibokA","description":"Epilogue.

Ah well, at least it fell near enough to Christmas. What a coinkydink! With nearly 4 times the votes, it was decided that a massive tickle picture of the New Hatchford girls would be the one. However, they did not come alone. Rather, they are tickled by their outgoing counterparts, who we last saw in a Christmas picture two years ago and are making a one-off return. Man, time flies. I matched up the old and new characters depending on how much they have in common with each other, as follows... Lauren and Nadja, getting her navel and midriff tickled by the former, are both exotic curvy girls who share tastes in dancing (belly dancing particularly), socialising and dating many men. Robi is tickling a hogtied Folami's feet. Both are outspoken, love hip-hop, have a sense of pride for their hometown and even speak in street dialect regularly. Like Folami and Nadja, Robi and Lauren are best mates. Kitty Marie is pretty much the prototype of Ingrid, or directly influenced her creation, because they share so much in common. They are blue-eyed brunette musicians who are middle-class and trendy, wear striped tops and dislike their feet getting touched. No wonder why Ingrid's face is that of panic and ticklish laughter as Kitty lightly strokes those big feet of hers. Ana-Lea brought her black labrador (or as she lovingly calls him - \"that stinky dog\") to lick away the grease off the soles of her shy Irish counterpart Mairead. Both are perpetually barefoot, auburn-haired and have very sensitive skin. Bey is relentlessly working over the vulnerable armpits of a bound Darlene - a fellow blonde who debuted before everyone else in the cast like Bey before her and is\/was a favourite with the fans during their tenure. The Chimpette is in the back getting her feet licked in stocks by a baby reindeer (because Christmas) as the Chimp happily looks on unconvincingly in a Santa suit (because Christmas). If you don't know why there were matched here, you're probably new... I hope you all enjoy this picture card, and thank you once again for you continued patronage!

Ridiculous o_o. Ridiculously awesome, that is! Anyway, thanks everyone <3. 11\/22\/07: .....1000 faves....omg o_o. THANK YOU EVERYONE. I can't believe it...:'D EDIT4 9\/29\/07: Over 900 faves O___O -shocked- Ya'll are the best eeee !! And I'm uploading a newer version with even more watermarks due to more people trying to sell it. ....please, guys, DON'T steal and sell! EDIT3 8\/7\/07: Wow.....800+ faves OMG XD. I'm so, so happy that you guys like this picture so much. Thank you all!!! EDIT2 8\/12\/06: Almost a year later, and 300+ favs! Thank you all so, so much!! Unfortunetely, after an incident with an art thief who was selling this picture...., I have decided to watermark it. I really didn't want to have to, since I find that watermarks that do their job well usually wreck the presentation of the image completely. I'm going with minimal watermarking--I placed my little mini dragon watermarks on all four phoenixes as well as a text one, so hopefully that will be enough. If not....I guess I might have to watermark across the phoenixes. So, PLEASE, guys, don't give me a reason to have to do that. DO NOT steal this picture. It is NOT yours; you did not spend hours making it. And, guys, this should really go without saying, but apparentely some people have to be told: definitely do NOT sell my art without my permission. Anyway, thank you all for 300+ favs and enjoy the four phoenixes of the elements ^___^! Available as my first ever Print! The complete \"Phoenix of the Elements\" series! All the birds here are phoenixes, as in the Phoenix or Firebird, the fantasy bird who can burn itself into ashes at the end of its life and be born anew. Thinking about that bird, I thought, why not make a phoenix who is reborn from water (the Ice Phoenix), or never dies (the Earth Phoenix), or dissapears with the weather (the Air Phoenix)? And that's where this series came about from. I made up all the phoenixes, except the fire one, of course. The traditional phoenix is usually described as being a swan-sized bird with scarlet and gold feathers (sometimes the feathers are sapphire colored) and a brilliant crest. All of my phoenixes have necks more like real birds instead of swans because, let's face it, they might not fit into the picture otherwise XD. Here's information on all 4 of them (I made up all this info, by the way ): The firey Phoenix of the Volcanoes and Fire is in the top left. This is the well-known phoenix of fire, also called the Firebird. He is commander over all that is flame. When his busy, hot-headed life is over, he soars into a volcano. When the volcano erupts, his ashes reform themselves into a new phoenix. Fire can always be reborn, as all that's needed is a little spark from nature or humans. This one here has just been reborn and shows off his majestic beauty in front of his \"pyre.\" The cold Phoenix of the Ice Caves and Ice\/Water is in the top right. An ice phoenix is a brother of the well-known fire phoenix. It is very similar to it's brother, the exceptions being how it is reborn and it's coloring, which consists of vivid blues and whites. When it is time for an ice phoenix to be reborn, it builds itself a pyre and sets itself alight. Instead of turning into ashes, however, an ice phoenix will melt like an icecube would and turns into a puddle of frigid water. Within the hour, a new chick emerges from the water. You'll know when it's about to come because the water freezes solid, and then the chick bursts free. The aware Phoenix of the Earth and Ground is in the bottom right. The phoenix of the earth is a creature who has been called by many names over the years: Mother Earth, Nature, and others. He creates mountains with the beats of his wings, ridges by scraping his talons against the soil, and flat deserts with his tail feathers. The Earth Phoenix is unlike other phoenixes in that he does not reincarnate. When he dies, there will be no place to live, and therefore no rebirth. We must help to take care of him and his earth. Lastly, the fabulous Phoenix of the Skies and Weather is in the bottom left. The Phoenix of the Skies, also known as the Air Phoenix, is a truly important bird. She is in charge of of all things related to the sky, such as light, dark, clouds, weather, stars, and the colors of the world. Pretty important job, don't you think? She shares an almost ying-yang connection with the Phoenix of the Earth. Unlike the Earth phoenix, however, and more like the Ice and Fire, she can become reborn. At the end of her life, she fades into mist and cries. The tears fall down to the earth as rain and the mist makes up the storm clouds until, finally, she returns to her solid state, a brand new bird. Her joy is expressed in a beautiful show of colors: a rainbow. And then she resumes her job over all things in heaven's domain. I'm so happy to be finished. Here you can see that all along (from picture 2 onward) I was planning for this print. I made them facing each other in alternating poses and there are many similarities among them. (For example, the fire and ice both have their wings folded and are in side views. The earth and air both are in 3\/4ths view and their wings are spread. Other similarities exist .) Thanks for looking and please do comment! If you would like to buy a print, go ahead . All these pictures are Â© to me, \"Kalico\" Kat, 2005.

I do love to eat at Wendy's and I've always liked the look of their girl-next-door mascot. The first one is KFC's Colonel Sanders. The dialogue just came to me when I was doing the image. The pose was inspired by a vampire anime\/manga series I saw on another site (can't remember the name though). This pic has Premium Content available. The high-res file (16x21\") of this and a TOPLESS version (no bra, bare shoulders) are both available as a premium item bundle for just 50 DA points (or around 50 CENTS I think).

Thank you, Tiriol for having help me with the designs, colors and material of the uniforms ( I get to wear that coat Finland is wearing ) Finland and Mannerheim was recommended to me two years ago, but I've waited till this momentous occasion to put the idea to paper Nope! Just kidding. I was procrastinating and being uninspired by the lack of sunlight. I made around 3-4 sketches with different idea, Mannerheim reading, Mannerheim riding horse, etc and I realized I can't draw horses Then it struck me 2 days ago that Finland's 100th birthday will be on December 6 and I have not dome anything. I rushed too make the final sketch. I tried to illustrated Mannerheim to resemble how he is in real life as much as possible (avoiding turning him to a Dr. Phil look-alike as with the case of Otto von Bismarck hanakoofthejungle.deviantart.c\u2026) I started doing line art only at 2 a.m on 6 December and finished coloring around 8.

I am here to discuss a massive problem I have with the fandom. --- One thing that myself and many other dragon artists have noticed, is the massive surge in comments comparing our work to Wings of Fire. Yes, a few of us have drawn WOF fan art and that is sure to draw in the WOF community, but it's when we get comments like that on our drawings of our original characters who look absolutely nothing like anything from the WOF universe that really pisses us off. Yes, I used to experience something similar when I still drew Warriors and Cats, but let me explain: Warriors is set in a universe very similar to our own (just with feral cats able to form a complex political hierarchy), so any original cat artwork with normal-looking cats set in a pleasant European-looking forest is bound to be compared to Warriors, because there are very few surface differences. Wings of Fire, on the other hand, takes place in a highly-developed fantasy universe, with very distinct styles for the dragon species (so far as having drawings of what each species looks like at the beginning of the books), and having very detailed descriptions of the dragon societies and cultures. Wings of Fire is VERY unique and easy to recognise. This is why it is so insulting to us dragon artists when you say \"this looks like Wings of Fire\". 99% of us have our own original stories with our own unique ways of drawing dragons (almost all of which bear no resemblance to the Wings of Fire dragons). You aren't paying any attention to what we draw other than the fact that there are dragons in it. This is incredibly shallow and completely disregards all the hard work that myself and other dragon artists put into our character designs and stories. I mean, I even received a comment on my Spyro Hero MAP saying \"this looks like Wings of Fire\". WHAT?! Spyro and Wings of Fire and the most polar opposites in terms of tone and style! Not to mention Spyro came out 13 years before the first Wings of Fire book was published! The only thing they share in common is, of course, there are dragons in them. To all younger WOF fans, PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS TO ANYONE! It is incredibly insulting and honestly it makes me want to stop making Wings of Fire art.","medium":null,"title":"Let's talk about the Wings of Fire Fandom Blaze-TFD Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings Blaze-TFD #oc #dragon #dragons #rant #spyro #talk #wings #wingsoffire #blazethefiredragon #fire (show more)","url":"https:\/\/blaze-tfd.deviantart.com\/art\/Let-s-talk-about-the-Wings-of-Fire-Fandom-682020899\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"LetstalkabouttheWingsofFireFandomBlazeTFDWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsBlazeTFDocdragondragonsrantspyrotalkwingswingsoffireblazethefiredragonfireshowmoreimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/blaze-tfd.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/ede7\/i\/2017\/142\/b\/4\/let_s_talk_about_the_wings_of_fire_fandom_by_blaze_tfd-dba22oz.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"poopysocks","description":"Decided to have a go at my favorite Disney villian","medium":null,"title":"Maleficent poopysocks Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings poopysocks","url":"https:\/\/poopysocks.deviantart.com\/art\/Maleficent-393395484\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"MaleficentpoopysocksWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingspoopysocksimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/poopysocks.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/4f5d\/th\/pre\/i\/2013\/227\/4\/9\/maleficent_by_poopysocks-d6i7twc.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"MissPolycysticOvary","description":"my tablet pressure stopped working but i wanted to draw a pearl so bad i just did it without the pressure","medium":null,"title":"bad pearl MissPolycysticOvary Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings MissPolycysticOvary #su #pearl #pearlstevenuniverse #steven_universe #stevenuniverse #stevenuniversefanart #pearlcrystalgems #pearl_steven_universe #badpearl #bad_pearl (show more)","url":"https:\/\/misspolycysticovary.deviantart.com\/art\/bad-pearl-675778508\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"badpearlMissPolycysticOvaryWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsMissPolycysticOvarysupearlpearlstevenuniversestevenuniversestevenuniversestevenuniversefanartpearlcrystalgemspearlstevenuniversebadpearlbadpearlshowmoreimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/misspolycysticovary.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/9e79\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/108\/2\/4\/bad_pearl_by_misspolycysticovary-db6ca18.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"Juggertha","description":"Done up for an art challenge, I figured I'd show my excitement for the new movie coming out.

For those of you who dont remember (which no doubt would be most of you), Eclipse is my own personal superhero. His real name is Deacon Ford, a clinically depressed student in New York, attending an art college. He has the ability of shadowmancy, the ability to create, manipulate, and turn shadows into tangible objects. In reality, shadows are not the abscence of light, they are in fact dark energy, a form of matter that scientists have not discovered. Light displaces the dark energy and causes it to move, as if you were to place an object in a bucket of water, the water would just be displaced. Eclipse has the ability to see in the dark, as well as bend shadows to his will. Anyway, Ill post more of his backstory later on. For now, enjoy the drawing! ^^ Used ~Falln-Brushes's smoke brushes for the smoke effect.","medium":null,"title":"Eclipse DavidFernandezArt Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings DavidFernandezArt","url":"https:\/\/davidfernandezart.deviantart.com\/art\/Eclipse-81652516\/?purchase=print&itemids=19","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"EclipseDavidFernandezArtWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsDavidFernandezArtimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$24.95","artistURL":"https:\/\/davidfernandezart.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/69bc\/th\/pre\/i\/2015\/126\/0\/7\/eclipse_by_davidfernandezart-d1cm3hg.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Black"],"artist":"PerfectBlue97","description":"EDIT: YAY published in EQD www.equestriadaily.com\/2012\/10\u2026 This comic strip is loosely based on the scene from Episode 17 Season one of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - Stare Master - where Fluttershy forces her chickens back into their coop using the force of her stare. I've kinda extrapolated that into a Hypnotoad-meets-Jedi-Mind-Trick thing. The last frame is the punch-line. She's trying to get you to recommend this to a fan site. A homage of sorts to Hypnotoad Some of this comic is drawn from scratch in Photoshop using a mixture of brushes, layers and vectors. Other components have other sources, which I have favorited and linked to below. The ponies are based on images generated using General Zoi's pony Flash tool: (generalzoi.deviantart.com\/#\/d4\u2026, with some modification. I re-drew Fluttershy's eyes using a combination of Brushes and Vectors, using this tutorial as a guide (mlp-vectorclub.deviantart.com\/\u2026. Yes, I do realize that there is a layering error, I tried to upload a fixed version, but it's still using the old one for some reason. Frame 1 The background in Frame 1 is Matty 4z's MLP Garden Path (perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/f\u2026. The chickens, chicken coop, fence etc were scratch built using a combination of brushes and vectors (except for the eyes, which are just shrunken down pony eyes from General Zoi's pony creator). Fluttershy's Cutie Mark was created by Grendo11: (grendo11.deviantart.com\/galler\u2026. As was Twilight Sparkle's Cutie Mark: (grendo11.deviantart.com\/art\/Tw\u2026. Frame 2 The background is scratch built. I couldn't find a good image of Gilda from the series that I likes, so I created a posable Gilda using a combination of vectors, brushes and Photoshop layers. I used these images to get the look right, Sulyo's Roaring Gilda: (sulyo.deviantart.com\/art\/Gilda\u2026, PeachSpice's Gilda Vector: (peachspices.deviantart.com\/art\u2026, and Elsdrake's Hippogriff Gilda: (elsdrake.deviantart.com\/art\/Hi\u2026. The head in frame 4 was entirely drawn by Sulyo: (sulyo.deviantart.com\/art\/Gilda\u2026, and is used here with their kind permission. As I couldn't draw one nearly good enough. The eye was also Created by General Zoi's pony Flash tool: (generalzoi.deviantart.com\/#\/d4\u2026 for expediencyconsistency. I previously used this image in Fluttershy's Secret. Frame 3 The background Is Rarity's Room by Mandy Dax (perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/f\u2026. Sweetie Belle was created using General Zoi's pony creator, but was modified as I couldn't get the pose right in the pony creator. It was inspired by this image (moongazeponies.deviantart.com\/\u2026. Rarity's Cutie mark is from UP1TER (up1ter.deviantart.com\/gallery\/\u2026 Frame 4 I've basically used parts from the other frames here. Nothing much new.

The main purpose of this art piece is rather interesting. When I look back at some of the fanfictions I wrote, I realized that only two of them (\"Certificate of Excellence\" and \"Shut the Duck Up\") seemed to have the type of humor that replicates the actual show, as all my other fanfictions have some form of drama to them, and would usually depict thing you'd never see in the show (violent assaults, massive hate crowds, real-life songs). I made this comic to see if I can create something Loud House related that actually has the type of humor the show has. As such, I examined some images of the Loud House graphic novels online to see what the humor is like, and tried to brainstorm some ideas, and this was one of them. I actually have a few more in mind, and would release them soon. Also, I thought it'd be fun if I nicknamed my comics like the names of the graphic novels. I thought \"My Own Little Chaos\" was perfect, since it's a fanmade project, and it makes it look like I'm throwing in my two cents for an upcoming product. Real fact: It took me two days to make this whole comic. The hardest part was outlining it. I guess it's true that that more detail there is in a drawing, the harder it is.","medium":null,"title":"My Own Little Chaos: Crayon Craziness AnimationFan15 Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Comics Strips AnimationFan15","url":"https:\/\/animationfan15.deviantart.com\/art\/My-Own-Little-Chaos-Crayon-Craziness-719355287\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Comics","Strips"],"filename":"MyOwnLittleChaosCrayonCrazinessAnimationFan15WatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaComicsStripsAnimationFan15image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/animationfan15.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/8b19\/th\/pre\/f\/2017\/344\/b\/1\/my_own_little_chaos__crayon_craziness_by_animationfan15-dbwaa3b.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"GashibokA","description":"<notice> I'm back.

Also, it's the first time that most of this new cast have been tickled for the first time, such is the way that newcomers to my art world have to be initiated. Usually my pictures aren't that massive, but with new tech I can at the very least post some higher resolution images in the future. I've started to use the watercolour tool along with airbrush - especially with the hair, as it's much neater and easier to do. Anyway, thanks for being there, being patient and giving the support that helps my motivation to do these things... when I have the time. Also, out of the six ladies tickled here, who has the most ticklish feet out of all of them? You won't win anything for guessing right, except basking in your out rightness, maybe...

The lack of lead up and detailed explanation on this page reflects the fact that the comic was supposed to be a lot shorted and simpler than it ended up being. EDIT: I've had a some people react quite badly to this comic. Some even found it a little distressing that I've taken Twilight's horn away (Wounded veterans have been been mentioned in the comments). When I first wrote this comic, my vision was that this was an academic exercise set by Celestia to help Twilight to better relate to other ponies, as well as to better understand herself. So I've updated the text to clearly state that this fact. I've also tidied up the page a little. Still the original vectors, though. This edit means that some of the following pages might sound a little odd. Original Description I know that it doesn't look much, but this is my most ambitious Pony comic to date. I've tried to use as many original components as I can (Inkscape and Photoshop), but you might recognize some old favorites from other (more talented) authors. This comic was inspired by the episode Winter Wrap-Up, where Twilight tries to get by without using her Magic, but in the end she uses it even though she isn't supposed to. Princess Celestia sent Twilight to Ponyville in order to get to know other ponies, and to discover life outside of her books and magic, but in most episodes she seems to solve problems using books and magic. Twilight solved three simple problems with magic, that any Earth Pony could have solved using their hooves. She used her magic instinctively. Princess Celestia wants her to find a way to do things without using magic, and to see things from other pony's perspectives. She's not being cruel (and this is supposed to be the \"real\" Celestia). She's trying to help Twilight to explore the other things that make Twilight Sparkle who she is. Anything that isn't directly attributed to somebody is either based on an image from the show's advertizing material for the show, or is scratch drawn (Some things are a combination of the two). I didn't use General Zoi's Pony Creator for any of this (yay). As you can see from the \u201CCyclops\u201D pony in frame 7, I'm still getting to grips with Inkscape, and Ponies in general. Twilight Sparkle's Cutie Mark is by Grendo11 (grendo11.deviantart.com\/art\/Tw\u2026) Part 2: perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/a\u2026 (Updated version) Part 3: perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/a\u2026 Part 4: perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/a\u2026 Part 5: perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/a\u2026 Part 6: perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/a\u2026 Part 7: perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/a\u2026 Frame 1, Scootaloo's expression is based on this image (bobthelurker.deviantart.com\/ar\u2026). Frame 3 and 4: Background (gameguy001.deviantart.com\/art\/\u2026). Frame 5: Rainbow Dash is Angry Rainbow Dash by 90Sigma (90sigma.deviantart.com\/art\/Ang\u2026). Derpy's Cutie Mark is by Ooklah (ooklah.deviantart.com\/art\/Cuti\u2026). Frame 6: The background is from the show itself. Frame 7: Background is Library Upper Floors (Twilight's Bedroom) by DaringDashie (daringdashie.deviantart.com\/ar\u2026). Frame 8: Sorry, I'm being really lazy here. This is from the show itself. I wonder how Celestia is writing that letter without using her magic (no glow?). Frame 9: This one is based on a couple of different images. Including Veggie55's Rainy Days (veggie55.deviantart.com\/art\/Ra\u2026) and Library Upper Floors (Twilight's Bedroom) by DairingDashie (daringdashie.deviantart.com\/ar\u2026). I used them both as a base. One for the window and the other for the curtain, along with some tweaks. Also based on the original image from the show. Frame 10 and 11: Same as above.

Just finished a pretty long livestream colouring this, but it was fun~ The context I imagine for this picture: Spirit was just hesitantly trying to make some little joke, a rather flirtatious one, so he was sure it would either go over completely the wrong way or just end up being really awkward. Best case scenario, she found it funny. But surprisingly, not only did it actually WORK on her but was far more effective than Spirit Wind could have imagined, as the very next moment he's blinded by a wall of feathers Hehe I just love how this came out. it was a cute and funny little idea and was fun to draw. Good practice too and some awkward posing there to work with. Just came off a long live stream on Picarto doing this, so a big thanks to everypony who watched!! Oh, and in case it isn't pretty obvious by now by all the subtle little hints like pictures and small cameo's of derpy in the background of pretty much any picture featuring Spirit Wind here, I like Derpaderp quite a damm lot. pretty much about the same as I love Pinkie Pie at this point X3 she's so loveable and endearing and adorable.

It's just that if I don't post this now, I'll either have to just settle for it being out of date or wait another eleven months or so for it to fit the season again.","medium":null,"title":"Halloween Surprise rocketXpert Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Comics Other rocketXpert #crossdress #crossdressing #forced #french #frenchmaid #halloween #maid #sissy #tv #feminization #forcedfeminization (show more)","url":"https:\/\/rocketxpert.deviantart.com\/art\/Halloween-Surprise-569339311\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Comics","Other"],"filename":"HalloweenSurpriserocketXpertWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaComicsOtherrocketXpertcrossdresscrossdressingforcedfrenchfrenchmaidhalloweenmaidsissytvfeminizationforcedfeminizationshowmoreimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/rocketxpert.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/2024\/th\/pre\/i\/2015\/303\/f\/5\/halloween_surprise_by_rocketxpert-d9eyx0v.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"LadySleepsAlot","description":"Not sure if the category is correct.

This is a Patreon reward for all Â£20 supporters of my comic, Between the Vale! They will get the full-sized, un-watermarked wallpaper version The story behind this image is how Dar'Akunai, the Eldest of the Dragons, became the most powerful dragon in the world. In this world, the dragons fell from the stars as meteors, or \"dark stars\". The dragons grew and formed around the meteor, and it became their hearts. Each dragon is born with a finite amount of magical energy, which can be utilised through their breaths. Most dragons only use their breath attacks sparingly, as each time they breathe fire\/ice (or pure cosmic energy as is the case with Akunai) they lose part of their energy. When they use up all of their energy reserves, they die. But Akunai was greedy. He learned that if he devoured his own kind, he would gain their magical energies. His meteor heart became so full that it has begun to crack his mortal vessel. Akunai grew so large and so powerful that the rest of the dragons of the Vale have gone into hiding, fearing for their lives. Akunai gave himself the title of \"Dar\", meaning \"Lord\" in the language of the gods, though his own kind simply refer to him as The Cannibal.

(I think I might have sold two shirts.) This is a redrawn version of My favorite Tetsuko drawing; I thought I'd \"improve\" the drawing by fixing a few of the things I thought could be improved in the original drawing (like wider hips); I also thought she needed a bikini top that fit better. But when I was done, I found that I still liked the original better. Still, I figured that the newer art better reflected my style at the time, so I used this art in the Cafepress merchandise. A couple of years ago, I also started a store at TeePublic, because it offered better artist margins. For the T-shirts I sell there, I decided to do a re-tracing of the first drawing, keeping it as close to the original as possible (except for the better-fitting bikini).

She was an Officer in the Alliance defense fleet but resigned from her duty because of the immense bureaucracy there. She joined Galacta-Force instead to make a positive difference in the Galaxy and underwent exposure to Omni particles which gave her the ability of Laser Manipulation and Telepathy. Now she helps to keep the peace across the Galaxy as Lazer-Hawk. PERSONAL DATA Characteristics: Â· Species: Praxian Â· Age: 32 Â· Height: 5\u201911\u201D Â· Weight: 124lbs Â· Eye Color: Violet Blue Â· Hair Color: Black (with luminescent strands) Â· Skin Color: Violet Status Â· Place of Birth: Praxis Â· Citizenship: Betrassus Â· Base: The Ixion Interceptor, Galactor Prime (Galacta-Force Headquarters) Â· Occupation: Space Explorer, Diplomat Â· Known Relatives: Mevtr Rannz(Father), Slexi Rannz(Mother), Kotva Ranzz(Older Brother, Deceased), Kryx tol Rannz(Older Brother), Ryruul(Little sister), Cozhana(Youngest sister), Ivtr Razz(Her C.O and FiancÃ©e, Deceased) . POWERS AND ABILITIES Power Grid Â· Intelligence: 4 Â· Strength: 4 Â· Speed: 7 Â· Durability: 3 Â· Energy Projection: 5 Â· Fighting Skills: 6 Laser Manipulation: Lazer-Hawk can create, shape and manipulate laser light, intense, coherent, monochromatic, parallel beam of light (infrared, visible, or ultraviolet) or other electromagnetic radiation, which is composed of waves of the same frequency and all in phase. Laser Attacks: she can create and project beams of laser that are capable of piercing virtually anything they come in contact with and have explosive properties Holographic Projection: she can create, shape and manipulate holograms, fully three-dimensional images of the holographed target Light speed: She is able to transform her body into living laser and can travel at the speed of light. Telepathy: She has the ability to mentally receive and transmit information. Enhanced Condition: Thanks to her genetic enhancements her body is at peak physical and mental condition which means that she is faster, stronger and smarter than anyone from her own race. Flight: Lazer-Hawk has the ability to fly and can perform interstellar space travel on her own Vacuum Adaptation: She has the ability to adapt to the vacuum of space unaided LIMITATIONS Â· May be unable to create laser, being limited to manipulating only from already existing sources. Â· She is limited to controlling lasers within a certain radius. Â· Her light attacks are ineffective against mirrored surfaces and may bounce off of them Â· She is vulnerable to Gravitational attacks SKILLS As a former member of the Alliance fleet she received advanced training in hand to hand and space combat. Thanks to her telepathic abilities she is Omni-lingual and is able to speak and understand any alien language fluently making her an expert in the art of diplomacy PARAPHERNALIA Her suit is specifically tailored to her power set and it is equipped with sufficient kinetic barriers to shield against energy and projectile based weaponry and can generate its own life support field when in deep space. The suit also comes with a protective navigation visor which she uses when in battle or making interstellar space travel PERSONALITY Ayala is more of a people person and has this ability to make someone feel good about his or herself. Though she is not very expressive in her behaviour she is a very sophisticated woman who has captivating charm and elegant taste. She has this nurturing personality about herself that draws people to her and will readily help a teammate or someone in need. She believes in diplomacy before violence but there are times where she may drop those ideals and do what must be done for the greater good. She is very intelligent and knows how to talk to people of different backgrounds. However she feels uncomfortable taking the role of a leader. But when the situation calls for it she will give it her all and lead her team to victory. She dreams of a peaceful Galaxy and will fight to make that dream a reality.","medium":null,"title":"Lazer-Hawk CAPTAIN-GAMMA Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings CAPTAIN-GAMMA #artist #comicart #comicbooks #oc #sciencefiction #scifi #space #superpowers #art #deviantart #deviantartrelated #digitalart #illustration #indiecomics #originalcharacter #superheroine (show more)","url":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/art\/Lazer-Hawk-682371969\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"LazerHawkCAPTAINGAMMAWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsCAPTAINGAMMAartistcomicartcomicbooksocsciencefictionscifispacesuperpowersartdeviantartdeviantartrelateddigitalartillustrationindiecomicsoriginalcharactersuperheroineshowmoreimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/c74e\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/144\/2\/c\/lazer_hawk_by_captain_gamma-dba9lkx.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"ErikVonLehmann","description":"Spider-Blume or maybe Mary Jane desktop wide High resolution version on my Patreon page here www.patreon.com\/posts\/spider-b\u2026 commissions open youtube www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC_0e3\u2026 tumblr erikvonlehmann.tumblr.com\/ MSN (skype) daxerxes@hotmail.com twitter twitter.com\/EVLehmann facebook Erik Von Lehmann www.facebook.com\/people\/Erik-V\u2026 facebook like page www.facebook.com\/EVL-164144153\u2026","medium":null,"title":"Spider-Blume ErikVonLehmann Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings ErikVonLehmann #blume #evl #maryjane #spiderman #erikvonlehmann #spiderblume","url":"https:\/\/erikvonlehmann.deviantart.com\/art\/Spider-Blume-648683213\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"SpiderBlumeErikVonLehmannWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsErikVonLehmannblumeevlmaryjanespidermanerikvonlehmannspiderblumeimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/erikvonlehmann.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/5053\/th\/pre\/f\/2016\/335\/1\/6\/spider_blume_by_erikvonlehmann-daq7j65.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Spidersaiyan","description":"So here's my OC, Lacey Highwater. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the character, she comes from a (yet unnamed) fictional, Steampunk-inspired world. She's somewhat of a feminist character, and would be considered tomboyish compared to the more \"proper\" way that women are supposed to be portrayed in her era. She has a steam-powered motorcycle of sorts, which she uses to get around. Her full back-story and additional characters aren't fully developed yet, but I hope to further develop her world\/story in the future. She would be the main protagonist\/hero of the story, though! I haven't drawn her for a while, and felt that I wanted to update her look slightly, while keeping the feel of the original. I made her belt more functional, instead of just being a flashy way to hold the key to her ride! I tried out some new stuff with the colouring technique, which I'm thinking of doing a lot more often now, since I like the result! To see some of my older pieces (with varying quality) featuring Lacey, click here: [link] Special thanks to for all his help throughout the process; especially with his help in fixing an issue in the pose, during the early stages of the piece!

Upon further investigation, I have found out their complaints were understandable, and I have concluded that keeping his OC in this comic can possibly attract negative impact. Therefore I have accepted their criticism, and decided to refund Chidney. I sincerely apologize to the Chinese readers for the disappointment estories.deviantart.com\/ beniachi.deviantart.com\/ If you want hear about this comic's news immediately, follow this twitter account.

So there I was, last May, driving down Main Street on a quiet Wednesday morning. Its one of those cute Main Streets with lots of shops and cafes, but early enough that it was still fairly quiet. Now, I have a sort of Spidey sense for when an attractive woman is about. An itch at the back of my mind. And it starts pinging like crazy! I look over in front of the post office and see this very fit young lady bending over in a way I thought women only did in pornos, her wee skirt riding up over her ass, rummaging for something in her purse. The street was relatively empty of pedestrians at that point, but I almost crashed the Gao Mobile into the car in front of me! I glanced up in my rear view mirror, and the guy in the work van behind me (who almost crashed into me) was practically chewing on his steering wheel at the display!

Theoritically, due to the fact this comes the subconscious mind, it classifies as a subtly surreal piece. Fantasy appears to be is subject matter, but not its style, fantasy is not a style but a subject matter. And yes i dream in fantasy ... a lot. i mean i play fantasy RPG's, dnd, write fantasty stories and the like. Its always on the go in my head so it always seeping into my dreams. the only times it doenst it when i have a major problem in real life or a have a toxic dream resulting in zombies. Peoples view on surrealism is that it needs to look like Dali, if this is the case then art movement princples are ignore for the sake of 'copying' a artists style of drawing. but enough of that, i dont profess to be a surrealist artist. all i can vouch for is that the subject matter of this piece was from a genuine dream. and really that all i can say. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, this needs a bit of explaining. The orange fairies are dreams, muses and sources of inspiration. The glowing girl is me, my inner child. the Bogloid holding my hand is my guardian to protect me while i sleep and to help gather muses and inspirations for me. the large tree with the glowing doorway is my mind, where all my ambisions and memories are kept. Inside of there these muses are turned into works of art the sprout from the tree. this mostly based on an ACTUAL dream i had. when i was little i had terrible night terrors, i had a stuffed toy of a monster and my mum told me it was to protect me while i sleep.

This shows how I react when I see NSFW work of my characters; I am usually angry and upset if and when I see it, but get torn as its usually very anatomically correct. Hence the joke. I just love showing these two in how they react so differently in a situation but also represent my feelings in this kind of scenario. Also Mary's face is so much fun to draw. I started a new offer during my livestreams on Picarto TV (Which take place every Friday at 2pm GMT LONDON TIME unless I am away at a convention or something) where I offer to do 30 minute drawing challenge for a small donation of Â£5 (or more if people want to). Join my LIVESTREAM every Friday at 2PM GMT LONDON TIME only on Picarto TV and chat with me live! picarto.tv\/MadMunchkin &n\u2026; You can also donate Â£5 or more to get your own 30 minute draw challenge sketch!

Its mission was decent, honest, and uncomplicated: air the best in animation 24 hours a day, seven days a week. No live-action. No agenda to push said live-action. And completely ran by people who gave a damn about animation. On the network's 20th anniversary, I present this piece, a modernization of the Cartoon Network \"movie theater\" scene with many of the shows on the network circa 2001. A lot has changed, and I've reflected that. And yes, I did include Adult Swim characters and TOM from Toonami, who wasn't included in the original. I included some DC characters like Robin from Teen Titans, Wonder Woman from Justice League, Superman, Batman from Brave and the Bold, Green Lantern from his self-titled series, and Artemis from Young Justice. I also put in some third-party shows like Total Drama, Yumi from Code Lyoko, Goku from DBZ, Sailor Moon, and Johnny Test (though I know lots of you guys and gals aren't fans, but it is a part of the network's history). Yes, I am aware that a lot of shows are missing, particularly many third-party shows that aired on the network. I decided to do that because of three reasons: I wanted to celebrate Cartoon Network's 20th anniversary with shows that either debuted or aired exclusively on Cartoon Network or managed by Cartoon Network, I didn't want the picture to be full of shows that are more closely identified with other networks more than Cartoon Network (most people think of Kids' WB rather than CN when it comes to Pokemon or Yu Gi Oh, Fox Box or Nickelodeon when it comes to Winx Club or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Fox when it comes to stuff like Family Guy, King of the Hill, and American Dad), and if I just put every single acquisition Cartoon Network made in this piece, there wouldn't be any room for any of the Cartoon Network stuff (and I barely had enough room for the Cartoon Network shows that I could fit in). And those looking at this in 2016 and beyond, take note this piece was created in 2012, and lots of shows currently on the lineup, including Steven Universe, Uncle Grandpa, Clarence, and a few others weren't on when this was made. Maybe if I make a piece in 2017, I'll definitely include them. And no live-action. At all. Wait, no, that's not true. Fleegle from the Banana Splits is here, but he doesn't really count for live-action. Unlike the previous piece, I did this from scratch. Empty theater, and looking for the right pictures for this piece. Lots of characters, lots of work. So, without much more commentary, happy 20th birthday Cartoon Network.","medium":null,"title":"This Is Cartoon Network (20th Anniversary Edition) nemalki Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Other nemalki","url":"https:\/\/nemalki.deviantart.com\/art\/This-Is-Cartoon-Network-20th-Anniversary-Edition-330115790\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Other"],"filename":"ThisIsCartoonNetwork20thAnniversaryEditionnemalkiWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsOthernemalkiimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/nemalki.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/875a\/th\/pre\/i\/2016\/143\/a\/8\/this_is_cartoon_network__20th_anniversary_edition__by_nemalki-d5gjiz2.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"gryce-allergies","description":"I miss the old days when I was glued in front of the TV and watched CARTOONNETWORK~ I came across a picture of the Kanker Sisters from Ed,Edd n Eddy and felt like doing a fanart of them....so here it is~! ta-dah~ From left to right: Marie Kanker, Lee Kanker and May Kanker Materials Used:- Black Gel Pen, Water Colour Pencils","medium":null,"title":"The Kanker Sisters gryce-allergies Watch Cartoons & Comics Traditional Media Cartoons Drawings","url":"https:\/\/gryce-allergies.deviantart.com\/art\/The-Kanker-Sisters-292423739\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Traditional Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"TheKankerSistersgryceallergiesWatchCartoonsComicsTraditionalMediaCartoonsDrawingsimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/gryce-allergies.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/00c7\/i\/2015\/115\/6\/8\/the_kanker_sisters_by_grace_allergies-d4u3nln.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"DocWendigo","description":"Simo loves fanservice!

They are whatever gender you want to see them as. Just like in the game, it is open to your own interpretation. The topic of gender really doesn't matter to the story I'm trying to tell - so I haven't bothered to think about it. And when I'm saying, 'eh, doesn't matter' - that doesn't mean Frisk doesn't have a gender, is nonbinary, or whatever. It just means I don't care or make it my business in deciding what their gender is. Male, female, both, neither, that is up to you to decide on an individual level. It's ambiguous in the game, it'll be ambiguous in the comic - whether they're genderless, male, or female, that'll be up to you to decide as an individual reader. Whatever pronouns you decide to use for Frisk are completely valid and acceptable. There is no wrong answer, here. Please stop witch-hunting people you think are using the 'wrong' pronouns. They're just interpreting the character in their own preferred way. Please be respectful of that. Thank you.","medium":null,"title":"Frisk Tyl95 Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Comics Strips Tyl95 #frisk #undertale #the_rivers_warning","url":"https:\/\/tyl95.deviantart.com\/art\/Frisk-639431902\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Comics","Strips"],"filename":"FriskTyl95WatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaComicsStripsTyl95friskundertaletheriverswarningimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/tyl95.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/c29e\/th\/pre\/i\/2016\/284\/a\/d\/frisk_by_tyl95-dakp8ta.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"machine56","description":"cover illustration for concept magazine (indonesian graphic design magz).","medium":null,"title":"WE CALL IT RAGE machine56 Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Vector machine56","url":"https:\/\/machine56.deviantart.com\/art\/WE-CALL-IT-RAGE-41759837\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Vector"],"filename":"WECALLITRAGEmachine56WatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsVectormachine56image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/machine56.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/93ed\/th\/pre\/i\/2013\/070\/9\/8\/we_call_it_rage_by_machine56-dov23h.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," White"],"artist":"ElementJax","description":"The absolute nightmare went through on this piece, plus photoshop was a whore and kept crashing in mid-saves.

Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him as her husband, she thought, \"He would rather have me than would old Frau Gothel.\" She said yes and placed her hand into his. She said, \"I would go with you gladly, but I do not know how to get down. Every time that you come, bring a strand of silk, from which I will weave a ladder.

Speedpaint: www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BESGqH\u2026 Hello friends I am excited to announce the my new comic series that I'm collaborating on with my boyfriend - Between the Vale! The prologue of Between the Vale tells the story of four of the world's greatest heroes and their most important adventure - to seal away the magical creatures who threaten to destroy their home! Yes, I know the main characters are humans (well, only one of the characters you see here is human. The others are an elf, a dwarf, an Old God and a big ol dragon), but if you're a fan of my series The Fire and the Phoenix you'll like this one too! We've put just as much effort into the lore, worldbuilding and characters as TFatP, and I'm enjoying working on it just as much! I'm hoping you'll check it out Characters in the foreground are: - Baltham (Elven Knight in golden armour) - Mier (Curly-haired human eating an apple) - Ethelion (Scarecrow-looking wizard in the wide-brimmed hat) - Brina (Female dwarf with a sweet 'stache) Where to find the comic: RIGHT HERE!

His name? Yogang Star! His name comes from the japanese for lava, Yogan, plus gangsta. Would be like lava gangsta...and in fact he is made of lava and black magma and loves gangsta rap! He's Mudds' older big bro and once he looked like Mudds, but his strong desire to wear a pair of awesome sneakers (he LOVES sneakers) made him evolve and develop longer legs. He's fast and strong and jumps as high as if he was flying. He's well respected among the L.A Kaiju FAM members, and a good comrade to Don Antler. Mudds also respects him as brother and wishes to be like him someday. You can check Yongang Star's shirt here: And for you guys new to L.A Kaiju FAM: L.A Kaiju FAM (Los Angeles Kaiju Family) is a mafia, a gang if you want, formed by Kaijus (japanase term for big and weird monster) from all over the world. They have fun bullying cities and making heroes suffer and if someone mess with them, they just destroy his city and eat up the whole population. They have their headquarters somewhere in Los Angeles.

(I also thought about this WAY more than I should have. My sincerest apologies to Lauren Faust. ) Inspired in part by Watership Down, I created a personification (ponysonification? ) of death for the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic universe (because I'm more than slightly unhinged) . I couldn't help wondering how death would happen for them, it being a magical land and all, so I hit on the idea that there would be some sort of entity that oversees the whole thing, just as Luna and Celestia deal with the moon and sun. And like Luna, she has different forms, though hers have nothing to do with being evil or power-hungry. Macaria's forms depend entirely on whom she is visiting, and their deeds in life would determine how they see her. In the case of a good, hard-working pony like Granny Smith, she would appear in this form because Granny Smith's good soul would cause her to see Death this way. A pony who had spent their life being evil, without truly repenting of their evil deeds, would see her in her other form, Hecate. (I'll be posting that version in a few days. ) If, for instance, a good pony and a bad pony were seeing her at the same time, they would still see her differently from one another. Because her appearance is based entirely on the perception of those she brings to the afterlife, no one actually knows her true form. Running with the Greco-Roman motif often invoked in the show (Celestia, Luna, Tartarus, Ursa Minor, etc. ) , I named her Macaria. In Greek Mythology, Macaria was the daughter of Hades and represented a 'blessed death' , i.e. she who ruled over the souls of those who had lived good lives. I thought that was a good fit, so I went with it. However, she would have many names depending on regional language differences. Macaria is how Twilight Sparkle etc. would know her. Zecora, on the other hand, would know Macaria by another name from her own language, and would have her own culture's stories surrounding her. I wanted Macaria to look related to the ponies whose souls she was guiding to the afterlife, but still somewhat alien, so I based her looks on the Windigoes from the Hearth's Warming Eve episode. That way, she would seem even more 'god-like' in appearance than the royal sisters (because, you know, Death. ) She's still got a cutie mark, but it's more for the sake of familiarity. Also, to make the whole thing streamlined, she rules over death for ALL of the creatures of that world, including zebras and griffons and such, so this is just the form she uses with ponies. Maybe someday, if I really lose my mind, I might try and draw her griffon\/zebra\/whatever form. We'll see. To the good, Macaria is gentle and merciful, and helps to ease their way into the new and potentially frightening realm of death. She's especially tender with those who die very young. However, death comes to all at some point, so she is also impartial in that regard. There is no escaping her, no matter how kind or beautiful she is. Unless Luna and Celestia, or any other beings in that world, turn out to actually be immortal and not just nearly immortal, they will eventually have to meet her like anyone else. All good souls are guided to the Elysian Fields (woo Greek mythology! ) by Macaria to spend eternity with their loved ones. (Or, if they were evil in life, to wander around alone and in darkness for eternity. Because a show for kids really needs this. Anyway, more on that part of Macaria's realm when I post the other half of this picture. ) It is important to note that Macaria\/Hecate walks among the beings of the MLP world all the time, but a pony can only see her if they're dead\/on the point of death. Or, in rare cases, she will appear to warn or comfort, but it is almost always her lot to wander their world unseen and unknown by the living. At most, living beings will feel her presence where there has been death, but that feeling varies with the manner of death\/individual feeling her presence. I'm sure most of you won't care to read this, which is fine. My brain wouldn't turn off until I stuffed myself full of turkey and passed out, so be thankful this explanation isn't a LOT longer. I'd be interested to know what other people have come up with for the ponysonification of death for this world, because I can't be the first to have thought about this. Note: Granny Smith is just here to be an example of a good pony. I PROMISE I DIDN'T KILL HER OFF.

Amber's designs... has changed around so much- just not satisfied. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I'm quite satisfied now. So I went back to her old design and decide that perfect straight hair suited her more, goes with her body; TALL and very voluptuous ( Kat calls her the Amazon) and since she masks most of her emotions, the bangs really suit her. Kinda was inspired for Anna Torv for the face- been watchin Fringe as of late and I love Anna's jaw structure. So A little background on her as she has not be really explained before: BATTLE-WISE: I don't really have Amber's power make earthquakes (maybe later), mostly because she believes in not manipulating the forces of nature for the use of destruction. It's a chaotic power after all. Since the earth's essence is well, her soul- Any source of it- be it sand, plant or rocks she is absolutely connected. She also connected to it by her senses which is one reason Amber is so introverted to saving humans as she believes that they are 'poisoning' the earth. These extra earthy- senses makes her an excellent tracker. She does however speed up the growth of plants at remarkable speed and can manipulate its movement. Most of her strongest attacks, literally start by a seed. Most of her weapons including her arrows have a plant seed that she has cultivated and when that arrow pierces flesh- she can literally turn her foes body into the seeds incubator and manifestly destroy her enemy from the inside out. Amber's aim is also notoriously accurate. If she missed, she missed on purpose. Along with the power of growth, she is also a healer. With her knowledge of plants and the powers itself. She can turn herself INTO the earth. Plant, rock, dirt you name it... Makes her a great spy AND Makes having her long hair easier to braid since it well, can pretty much braid itself. QUIRKS: Hates technology. Any man-made object disgust her just due to fact she's narrow minded and and cannot except the change in the world. So yes, a bit of a Hippie... But seems to hate most demons more. Also loves books (the irony) basically the walking directory of demons and their tales. Uh... doesn't really like men- pretty much sees them only as lecherous, unintelligent fools. Gonna have to change THAT*winks* ... Enter the skirt-chasing, charming, Cajun demon hunter.

Melissa was, in short, a sort of real life Jenny. While she was quite smart, she also was a bit ditzy and oblivious. She was also, like Jenny, built like the proverbial brick shithouse. Not fat - she was a cheerleader - but very very curvy in all the right places! She had an incredible chest. Easily D cups, but Melissa had not quite wised up to this fact yet- her bras were always a size or two too small. Her ample bosom was always spilling over the tops of her cups. She also had juicy thick hips and a nice round ass. Poor Melissa was always trying to wear denim miniskirts like the other girls wore, but her righteous booty was always making the skirts ride up dangerously high, exposing long lovely glimpses of her American thighs and often a bit more. So on this particular day, Melissa had worn a blouse to school that had way too many buttons running down the front. She was running late getting changed after gym class, and didn't have time to button them all up. She came bouncing into English class with her overworked bra and bountiful cleavage spilling everywhere, completely oblivious to the astounding display of flesh she was putting on.

Say-Goodnight is much shorter and can't see, so Socke lifts her (by the leash) so she can. of course, being a ragdoll, she just naturally assumes that limp position! Socke is the guy i told you about in earlier stories who brought to life Mister McBunbun, then used the same technology to mass-produce the Say-Goodnight Gracies. when the little Say-Goodnight Gracie depicted here (sometimes reffered to as Raggedy Anarchist) got tangled in the machine that produced the dolls and caused a fire, Socke returned to find his entire livleyhood burned to ashes. in a moment of passion, he shot himself in the head. Mr. McBunbun and Say-Goodnight salvaged what they could of the amazing machine and used it to fasion socke a prosthetic head. the only material available to them at the spur of the moment is the sock on Socke's foot. oh yeah -- and i know his hands are wierd. they're work gloves.","medium":null,"title":"Hanging Out RaggedyAnarchist Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings RaggedyAnarchist","url":"https:\/\/raggedyanarchist.deviantart.com\/art\/Hanging-Out-14556838\/?purchase=print&itemids=86","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"HangingOutRaggedyAnarchistWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsRaggedyAnarchistimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/raggedyanarchist.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/fe20\/i\/2005\/027\/0\/8\/hanging_out_by_raggedyanarchist.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Blue"],"artist":"NomisTTForever","description":"A gift for vanderband We at the studio of Vicecariously Confidential appreciate our regular clients.

I was trying to announce my Art Stream on EQD last night and some wires got crossed on their end...and they put the \"sample\" for the stream up as a Drawfriend! I know it's a repost, and it wasn't intended to be. I'm really sorry for any confusion, but my intent was simply to stream...not to repost an old image to the drawfriend! I love you guys! *** UPDATE (2011): I've noticed that the file I put up here was partly corrupted by the saving process (adding unwanted artifacts!). I've now corrected the file so it doesn't have any of the artifacts anymore. I also uploaded a larger one! I would like to say thank you to all who have Favorited this piece. I've been trying to thank you all personally, but DA thinks I'm spamming. XP I will get to it soon though! Another note - if you have been poking through my gallery or intend to, understand that I haven't posted anything current on my DA in nearly 5 years. I wasn't drawing much for the longest time - but MLP has brought back some of the magic that I used to feel while drawing. It's a very remarkable show! *** As suggested by a brony from the MMO-Champion Brony thread. No one really draws Star Swirl the Bearded (though I did manage to find a few images of him) - and since he's supposedly the most epic unicorn of all time, why not do an epic picture of him? Yeah. And stuff. No stealing him, because it's my art and Hasbro's character and I will MISH anyone who steals my art! This is the first time I attempted a background in the MLP:FIM style and I think it turned out pretty well. Note: His beard, tail and mane are pinkish because I found that white looked far too boring - so I made him match the G4 version of Star Swirl (even though she's a mare!) - so...yeah. And stuff. Took about 8 hours of working + diddling around. XD PS7.

Today's argument was with someone who said there is no emotion in digital art, and that the computer does all the work for you. Well, this is digital art. I was in tears drawing this. Look at how much emotion is in Maddy's face because she doubts herself as an artist because of what was said to me today. She is so upset and angry at herself that she runs and hugs a character that...whether she likes it or not, represents her creativity. That raw, unchecked crazy spontaneous creativity that can't be controlled. But it can be embraced. Mary Sue being unable to be sad just hugs her and smiles reassuringly. They may fight and often hate each other because of their differences but they're stuck with each other. They can't live without each other. The artist and her creativity personified. In a way they complete each other. I feel this picture shows both sides of the emotions of being an artist; it's not easy, it can be torture. But it's so much fun and brings so much happiness to people because they can express what they can't put into words. No matter if you use traditional or digital or a healthy balance of both. Your creativity comes from YOU. Not the tools you use. Don't let ANYONE tell you otherwise. EDIT: This year, my grandad on my mum's side purchased this piece from me.

He discovered it when his brother Urard made him watch over his daughter Cassandra from her earliest years. So here we have Iisjah, at Guernicas house, babysitting a small hoard of kids - his 8 year old twins Zoltan (redhead) and Suzanne (the blonde), on a weekly dad visit, his 11 year old niece Cassandra (brown haired) and Louis de Guernicas 11 year old daughter Julia (which Iisjah often babysits) They all are having a wonderful epic adventure full of magic and drama! Valiant hero Zoltan, riding on Iisjacorn, the prettiest and most magical unicorn in all the land, to face his pirate foes - one-eyed Casandra and captain Suzanne no-beard, which took the beautiful princess Julia prisoner. Epicness ensued. Iisjah is all nervous about that wooden sword - maybe making them wasn't such a good idea? And to think that Iisjah was a 'family-less orphaned as a child' guy just two years ago 8D Now he has massive family swarm xD Oh how they grow The painting in the back is heavily inspired by my childhood drawings Except the rainbow - I made mine fatter Where is Waldo? 8D ~~ A DD?

The very piece I have been pondering and wanting to do for bout a year but could not find the time to do so until now. The group that we all know and love embrace the Holiday Cheer. This design features the Turtles, Rainbooms and Human Allies as they all give a warm embrace of Christmas Cheer! A friend convinced me to have the Raimbooms, April, Karai and Shini dress up in their cute little elf outfits while the Turtles, Casey, and Spike the dog wear their Santa Claus Hats. Note: I had this done for two weeks but wanted to wait until Christmas Eve or Christmas Day to post this, just for the special occasion. I know that I said on the last design it was my last, but somehow I was all and inspired by the last design and after being convinced by a fellow follower and friend, I have decided to do this very special one, in dedication to the author of the Equestria Ninjas Fan Fictions (DarkMagicianmon) and to the followers of reading these fics and my designs (jebens1, TMNTony, rainbine94, lonewolf82084, and all the rest of you). This is for real this time, my final design piece til we hit 2018. I would still like to enjoy the rest of the Christmas month and New Years Eve-Day. So let me say again, Merry Christmas!! And A Happy New Year to all!!

She is an abnormal hybrid between a Source, a Shift, and an Outlaw. As a Source, her control over element and reality-bending is beyond masterful. She is so overwhelmingly powerful, that her power almost constantly remains active. The same could not be said about her abilities as a Shift. Though the Shift species are limited, unlike most Shifts, she does not have complete mastery over time and\/or space. Instead, her abilities are limited to allowing her to project herself and whoever accompanies her to the past, present or future but only as Astro projection of their selves with zero ability to interact with their non-present timeline. Though genetically she's classified as partly being affiliated with the Outlaw species, she bears no further relation outside of her DNA makeup. Unlike most unique beings, The Girl With No Name was born instead of being directly created by the deitic entities who control the universe. With so little known about this enigmatic being including her name and her whereabouts, The Girl With No Name is truly one of the most powerful mysteries of her universe.","medium":null,"title":"The Girl with no name by (JCComicsUniverse) CAPTAIN-GAMMA Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings CAPTAIN-GAMMA #comicbooks #comics #conceptart #crazybitch #design #illustration #indiecomic #oc #original #originalcharacter #pinup #pinupart #superpowers #telekinesis (show more)","url":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/art\/The-Girl-with-no-name-by-JCComicsUniverse-707026049\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"TheGirlwithnonamebyJCComicsUniverseCAPTAINGAMMAWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsCAPTAINGAMMAcomicbookscomicsconceptartcrazybitchdesignillustrationindiecomicocoriginaloriginalcharacterpinuppinupartsuperpowerstelekinesisshowmoreimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/598e\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/272\/7\/4\/the_girl_with_no_name__by__jccomicsuniverse__by_captain_gamma-dboy0sh.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Blue"],"artist":"Calipsolieu","description":"Finally, I did a StarCo fanart, my OTP<3 As you can see this is a redraw of a scene from the show, and in fact it was an ink sketch I did in my copybook some months ago, I just uploaded it and painted it digitally (I think thats the way Im going to do my drawings from now on, so I dont lose my practice on traditional art) I have a FB page guys!

(Spoilers for Moon Rising and Winter Turning) --- I adore these two. I've wanted to draw them ever since I read Moon Rising, and after learning that Darkstalker is half IceWing I realized that Darkstalker would look absolutely awesome and so I HAD to draw him. Even though NightWings are described as either being black or dark purple I've always pictured Moonwatcher as being dark turquoise because of the cover of Moon Rising. Also because she's the first NightWing with mind reading and prophetic powers in generations I figured she should look unique. Also, unlike the villains from the first series who I found a bit bland (with the exception of Burn, she was awesome because of how nasty she was) I find Darkstalker very intriguing because we don't know whether or not he really is a bad guy. We know he was extremely powerful and ambitious, and would go to any end, even murder, to succeed, but he cared deeply for his friend Fathom and his mate Clearsight, and even forgave them after they betrayed him. He's also a very considerate mentor for Moon, and is surprisingly calm and collected after learning that he's been asleep for 2000 years. The fact that he has also never appeared in person yet is also pretty awesome. See Erins! This is how you write an interesting 3-Dimensional character! Darkstalker is awesome.

Commission Prices (For Human Chibi and MLP)Before commissioning me, I would like for you to read the rules. If you do not read the rules and still send in a request for a commission, I will only link you back to here. RULES: I will not accept any commission based off of description. Please provide me a clear picture of your OC. If your OC was drawn traditionally, PLEASE take a clear picture and show some color on your character. It's not very easy trying to get the correct color from a colored drawing on paper on to a digital picture. Once you pay me, that is that. I do not do refunds, so you must be perfectly happy when I send you the sketch before paying. If I feel like your OC is too complicated to draw, I have the right to refuse your commission. So no complaining, please. Points are not accepted. If you feel like you can handle these rules, you can now look at the prices below. So here are the prices: $5 for a flat-colored picture. An additional $1 for another character.","medium":null,"title":"Laughter...?

We\u2019re still friends Twilight, no matter what or how difficult the situation is. If there\u2019s one thing I have learned from all this, is that....friends don't quit on each other! They stick together to the end. Leo continued on stating on what good they all have done for a long period of time. Leo- Aside from the times that we both had separate, We both have faced other impossible odds together. We stopped the alien invasions from both the Kraang and the Triceratons, saving both our worlds from destruction, putting an end to the Shredder in his super mutagen form, helped Blade Swipe reunite with his sister, Melody and the rest of the ponies, and Even help Stygian from succumbing to the Pony of Shadows and reconcile with Starlswirl and the Pillars. Facing the Storm King and Tempest will be no different! We\u2019ve been through a lot together, the good and the bad, with our friends. You even defended my life on Bleecker street from Shredder and his goons that one night in our world. You and your friends from CHS have shown all of us what the Magic of Friendship was really all about and we believed in it. The Twilight I know would never throw in the towel in the past encounters. And I\u2019m certainly not gonna be the one that will let you do so! Friends don't quit on each other!! Twilight, upon hearing Leo\u2019s words, snapped out for her sorrow. She then smiled a little bit and wrapped her arms around Leo in a tight embrace. Twilight- (Crying) Oh Leo.....I\u2019m so sorry about what I said and did to you. Leo held Twilight close. Leo- It\u2019s alright Twilight. Its gonna take a lot more than just a burst of magic to tear this bond apart. You are our best friend Twilight. The others still love you. My brothers still you. Spike still loves you......I still love you!! Twilight, heartwarmed by Leo\u2019s words again, calmed herself down. Twilight- (Lighter sobs) Oohh, I love you too Leo! Spike, upon hearing this smiled. A few tears were leaking from his eyes as he placed his claws onto his chest, feeling this moment coming to pass. Twilight paused for a moment Twilight- You\u2019re right though! We\u2019ll find another way out of this mess together! Leo then smiled at Twilight\u2019s recovery. Leo- But first things first, you need to make amends with the others. So let\u2019s return and get things back on track. Twilight- Yes And I think you all can figure the rest from there. Pretty heartwrenching eh?

But then the idea of having her as Robin instead not only made it more fun to draw, it also solved the glove problem. For me, Mary's gloves are like Maddy's hat; they both must be wearing hat and gloves...though I am cheating here since Maddy is wearing the batman cowl and mask, but she gets away with it. Mary Sue is already so over powered that it would make sense to have her as Superman instead of Robin. But I think here the joke works; she can't possibly be Batman since he actually has character flaws that are likable. Maddy being Batman is just rediculous because she's so short.

This skit is loosely based on this clips from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, where Gilda the Griffin makes Fluttershy cry: (www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3sHlZl\u2026). It's sorta a re-match, but with a twist. Some of this comic is drawn from scratch in Photoshop using a mixture of brushes, layers and vectors. Other components have other sources, which I have favorited and linked to below. The ponies are based on images generated using General Zoi's pony Flash tool: (fav.me\/d47efz4). I couldn't find a good image of Gilda from the series that I likes, so I created a posable Gilda using a combination of vectors, brushes and Photoshop layers. I used these images to get the look right, Sulyo's Roaring Gilda: (sulyo.deviantart.com\/art\/Gilda\u2026), PeachSpice's Gilda Vector: (peachspices.deviantart.com\/art\u2026), and Elsdrake's Hippogriff Gilda: (elsdrake.deviantart.com\/art\/Hi\u2026). The head in frame 4 was entierly drawn by Sulyo: (sulyo.deviantart.com\/art\/Gilda\u2026), and is used here with their kind permission. As I couldn't draw one nearly good enough. The eye was also Created by General Zoi's pony Flash tool: (fav.me\/d47efz4) for expediency\\consistency. Fluttershy's Cutie Mark was created by Grendo11: (fav.me\/d3jvy5x). As was Twilight Sparkle's Cutie Mark: (grendo11.deviantart.com\/art\/Tw\u2026). In case you're wondering, the strange markings on Fluttershy's face in frame 8 is supposed to be a shadow of Gilda as she is overcome by Fluttershy's curse. The Library scene in frame 9 and frame 10 was created by RilDraw, the original can be found here : (fav.me\/d4i2zoh).

LAZER-HAWK ORIGIN Lieutenant-Commander Ayala Rannz is a Praxian space explorer from Planet Praxis. She was an Officer in the Alliance defence fleet but resigned from her duty because of the immense bureaucracy there. She joined Galacta-Force instead to make a positive difference in the Galaxy and underwent exposure to Omni particles which gave her the ability of Laser Manipulation and Telepathy. Now she helps to keep the peace across the Galaxy as Lazer-Hawk.

Laser Attacks: she can create and project beams of laser that are capable of piercing virtually anything they come in contact with and have explosive properties Holographic Projection: she can create, shape and manipulate holograms, fully three-dimensional images of the holographed target Light speed: She is able to transform her body into living laser and can travel at the speed of light. Telepathy: She has the ability to mentally receive and transmit information. Enhanced Condition: Thanks to her genetic enhancements her body is at peak physical and mental condition which means that she is faster, stronger and smarter than anyone from her own race. Flight: Lazer-Hawk has the ability to fly and can perform interstellar space travel on her own Vacuum Adaptation: She has the ability to adapt to the vacuum of space unaided LIMITATIONS Â· May be unable to create laser, being limited to manipulating only from already existing sources. Â· She is limited to controlling lasers within a certain radius. Â· Her light attacks are ineffective against mirrored surfaces and may bounce off of them Â· She is vulnerable to Gravitational attacks SKILLS As a former member of the Alliance fleet she received advanced training in hand to hand and space combat. Thanks to her telepathic abilities she is Omni-lingual and is able to speak and understand any alien language fluently making her an expert in the art of diplomacy PARAPHERNALIA Her suit is specifically tailored to her power set and it is equipped with sufficient kinetic barriers to shield against energy and projectile based weaponry and can generate its own life support field when in deep space. The suit also comes with a protective navigation visor which she uses when in battle or making interstellar space travel PERSONALITY Ayala is more of a people person and has this ability to make someone feel good about his or herself. Though she is not very expressive in her behaviour she is a very sophisticated woman who has captivating charm and elegant taste. She has this nurturing personality about herself that draws people to her and will readily help a teammate or someone in need. She believes in diplomacy before violence but there are times where she may drop those ideals and do what must be done for the greater good. She is very intelligent and knows how to talk to people of different backgrounds. However she feels uncomfortable taking the role of a leader. But when the situation calls for it she will give it her all and lead her team to victory. She dreams of a peaceful Galaxy and will fight to make that dream a reality.","medium":null,"title":"Lazer Hawk Helmet Design CAPTAIN-GAMMA Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings CAPTAIN-GAMMA #comicart #design #oc #art #characterdesign #conceptart #digitalart #digitalpainting #originalcharacter #originalcharacters #superheroine (show more)","url":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/art\/Lazer-Hawk-Helmet-Design-681328446\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"LazerHawkHelmetDesignCAPTAINGAMMAWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsCAPTAINGAMMAcomicartdesignocartcharacterdesignconceptartdigitalartdigitalpaintingoriginalcharacteroriginalcharacterssuperheroineshowmoreimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/6cd9\/i\/2017\/138\/8\/a\/lazer_hawk_helmet_design_by_captain_gamma-db9n8e6.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"LimKis","description":"","medium":null,"title":"Frgt'n drms 03 LimKis Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Comics Vector LimKis","url":"https:\/\/limkis.deviantart.com\/art\/Frgt-n-drms-03-97675986\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Comics","Vector"],"filename":"Frgtndrms03LimKisWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaComicsVectorLimKisimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/limkis.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/d718\/th\/pre\/i\/2015\/125\/d\/4\/frgt_n_drms_03_by_limkis-d1m5j9u.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"sterna","description":"A poster from the Jessica Rabbit's Show in Stand alone version. two pose version : [link] bust version : [link]","medium":null,"title":"Jessica Rabbit Stand alone sterna Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings sterna","url":"https:\/\/sterna.deviantart.com\/art\/Jessica-Rabbit-Stand-alone-170957622\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"JessicaRabbitStandalonesternaWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingssternaimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$156.00","artistURL":"https:\/\/sterna.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/99ce\/i\/2010\/192\/1\/0\/jessica_rabbit_stand_alone_by_sterna.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"leandro-sf","description":"The lined version: My other Stuff:","medium":null,"title":"Commission Trouble in the sea leandro-sf Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Comics Other leandro-sf","url":"https:\/\/leandro-sf.deviantart.com\/art\/Commission-Trouble-in-the-sea-368842067\/?purchase=print&itemids=19","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Comics","Other"],"filename":"CommissionTroubleinthesealeandrosfWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaComicsOtherleandrosfimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$24.95","artistURL":"https:\/\/leandro-sf.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/2dab\/th\/pre\/f\/2013\/121\/9\/9\/commission_trouble_in_the_sea_by_leandro_sf-d63lkcz.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Blaze-TFD","description":"GEORGE IS SUCH A BEAN HE'S SO GOOD I drew this character from Spyro 2 as a warm up this morning and I just remembered how much I loved this character.

A new post! This week was terrible, computer crashed, didnÂ´t save\u0085 the day after that, they cut the electricity, didnÂ´t save. Lost my progress twice. The mantra for this week is \u0093save often\u0094!!!! IÂ´m on a fairy row!! A very possible scenario. There are lots of \u0093spider peril\u0094 pics out there. This idea has been circling my thoughts for a long time. I wanted to portray the sense of terror and helplessness that must be crossing tinkerbellÂ´s mind while being captured by a \u0093monstrous\u0094 garden spider. I searched the web for inspiration trying to find the perfect perspective and depth to communicate the \u0096use Mr. Smith voice- inevitability of tinkÂ´s fate. The inspiration came from the pic \u0093arachnophobia\u0094 by gamera 1985. Go check it. Imagine the precise moment she crashes into the web, an instant of WTF, followed by a gasp, shortness of breath upon realizing where she is, oh no , oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, no please no, she thinks-, heart racing at 200 per minute, she looks at the web strings, so thin and silky, so sticky, yet so resistant. She tries to break free. With each movement she gets ensnared more and more in the sticky threads . Each struggle signaling through vibrations that dinner is ready. The spider is the perfect bondage predator created by nature, cold and inexpressive, in a split second it falls over its prey, surrounding her, no escape, no use for screaming. First disabling the means of escape to secure the catch, some web strings around the wings, arms and legs, fighting becomes a very futile struggle with each web spun around her. Wings stop fluttering, Her movement reduced to a grub-like motion. The final struggles will be dealed with in no time, a small bite, some neurotoxin\u0085 waiting until it kicks in, watching how her strength abandons her, how she loses control of her body, how her muscles gradually cease responding, \u0085 The wonderful thing about web is its design by nature: thin but very resistant. I took research seriously and read some articles about spiderweb. I tried to portray web strings as a silky-thin-traslucid thread, not as a gooey thick blob that is usually drawn like. It also took some research time with layers and filters to get that effect. Hope it was worth it. I hope the spider is scary enough. Very satisfied with the background, wanted to transmit the sensation that the forest was helping the spider to catch tinkerbell, and if the spider failed, the forest would finish the job. ...Next time IÂ´ll use bigger leaves to show accurate scale. Used some tree and leaves brushes that I found on DA.Credit to The original title was \"Fairies canÂ´t scream\" since in the original movie, tinkerbell was mute. Then I remembered about the new tinkerbell series where she talks, so goodbye title. Couldnt think of a better one. Any suggestions? Does anyone reads this?","medium":null,"title":"Tinkerbell trapped cabroon Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings cabroon","url":"https:\/\/cabroon.deviantart.com\/art\/Tinkerbell-trapped-263634073\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"TinkerbelltrappedcabroonWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingscabroonimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/cabroon.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/83d7\/th\/pre\/i\/2011\/288\/4\/f\/tinkerbell_trapped_by_cabroon-d4cylcp.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"KDhynamo","description":"Edit: I wasn't happy with the fire, so I played with some layer settings to make it more luminescent and transparent. Very glad you can see her other eye now. I also made the sig more pronounced and made a few touch-ups here and there. Here to celebrate my 100th deviation we have the Blackâ˜\u2026Rock Shooter, who despite not really being a vocaloid has indeed been exposed to the office-catgirl-ification. First of all I should point out that this was a commission from *Kelanich, so if you like this and are feeling amiable, go thank him! Now prepare for a rant: I don't like to brag, but I think this is the best thing I've drawn to date. I say this knowing full and well that I will never produce something this good ever again, unless by some miracle I find a way to simplify my shading process. Blending in Photoshop using only the brush takes an enormous amount of time\/patience\/sanity. As of now I only have one of those things remaining... So yeah, probably my best contribution to the Nekoloid series. IA won't be nearly this detailed, as I think I'm going to return to the flat colored and sketchy style that I've been developing. I feel those drawing are more lively. Getting this done is basically quite a load off my chest. I hope you all like it, especially you Kel. Other Nekoloids: ----------------------- For the After *Shattered-Earth did a correction for my shading on one of my other nekoloids, I tried to keep her advice in mind as much as possible. However since I'm not a perfect student by any means, I most definitely have messed up somewhere. Please help me with shading!

I still donÂ´t get a hold on pen tool lineart. Still, I depicted mulan with a flowing, delicate lineart, like that of a calligraphy brush, with attention to line quality. On the other hand, ropes are straight and cold. Shan yu started as a pen tool lineart practice, but got bored and finished him freehand. Shan yu is evil. Disney character designers are geniuses. They managed to portray a very evil character that takes over you. I mean when you try to draw him, even if you are a beginner, you cannot draw him funny or goofy, you feel the weight on every line, each color was chosen to strike fear, and those reverse colored eyes, \u0093its like an alien\u0085 that stares into my soul\u0094 Added green lingerie as a final touch, kind of emulating a jade ornament (also the picture had no green on it, so now mulan stands out.) First time I use a double light source -suggested by the chinese lamp from the ceiling- because mulan was too dark with only the light from the window. Tried to stay true to chinese decoration; it is easy to confuse japanese and chinese culture at some details. I was going for a shibari style, but i like some simmetry on the ropes. Besides shibari is a japanese bondage art form.

I thought it would be nice to make him share some features with Spyro, since Ignitus was supposedly very fond of Pyra, he would then carry that fondness onto little Spyro when they first meet.

It's the first MLP strip that I've done where I haven't simply copied\\pasted other people's ponies in, or used a Pony Generator. Pretty much everything in this strip was created in either scratch drawn in Photoshop or Inkscape (My first Inkscape strip, yay) using images from the show, or other source material. Frame 1 Most of Frame 1 was scratch built in Photoshop or Inkscape. I used sircinnamon's Celestia ([link]) and McAwesomeBrony's Celestia ([link]) as a base for my own model. As well as a couple of different shots from the show. I imagine this is how Celestia would look as a teenager. She has pink hair as that's the color that is was show in the introduction to series one. I couldn't get the detail right on the crown or the necklace, so I put hearts in instead. I figure that she might have worn a different style when she was younger. I've also drawn her wings differently. They are much more pert than in the series. Kinda like when you're a teenager and you buy your first pushup bra, and it makes you've got Kim Possible boobs. Her Cutie Mark is from ooklah ([link]), as I saw no reason to go over old ground again. Frame 2 Frame 2 is pretty much like frame 1. Everything is either scratch built in Photoshop or Inkscape. Same base's Princess Celestia. Frame 3 Frame 3 is a based on Frame 2. I use transparencies and fill effects on her tail and mane in Inkscape to make it look like she's really angry then I exported it to Photoshop where I added the shadow, and tinted her colors to make it look like she's glowing with rage. I deliberately made her feathers spiky rather than smooth as in the show to show how angry she is. She's literately bristling with rage. I'd have liked to have the refrigerator melting away or the floor tiles cracking, maybe I will update it to include these things sometime. Maybe not. I guess that's what differentiates hobbyist like me from real artists. Princess Luna was drawn in Inkscape using images from the show as a base. I'm not particularly happy with the eyes or the mouth and may re-draw them some time. The eye was meant to look catlike, but it didn't come out so good, and the teeth are too small. Frame 4 I must admit here that the background from Frame 4 isn't my doing. It was drawn by theirishbronyx ([link]). The Moon Canon and Princess Luna were both drawn in Inkscape. Frame 5 See Frame 1 and 4.","medium":null,"title":"MLP FIM: Cake Monster PerfectBlue97 Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Comics Strips PerfectBlue97","url":"https:\/\/perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/art\/MLP-FIM-Cake-Monster-316302670\/?purchase=print&itemids=189","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Comics","Strips"],"filename":"MLPFIMCakeMonsterPerfectBlue97WatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaComicsStripsPerfectBlue97image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$68.95","artistURL":"https:\/\/perfectblue97.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/a8b1\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/206\/8\/4\/mlp_fim__cake_monster_by_perfectblue97-d58bgpa.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"MissPolycysticOvary","description":"","medium":null,"title":"fionna MissPolycysticOvary Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings MissPolycysticOvary #adventure #finn #fionna #adventuretime #adventuretimefinn #fionnaandcake #adventuretimewithfionnaandcake #fionnathehuman","url":"https:\/\/misspolycysticovary.deviantart.com\/art\/fionna-669827214\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"fionnaMissPolycysticOvaryWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsMissPolycysticOvaryadventurefinnfionnaadventuretimeadventuretimefinnfionnaandcakeadventuretimewithfionnaandcakefionnathehumanimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/misspolycysticovary.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/f530\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/077\/5\/a\/fionna_by_misspolycysticovary-db2spzi.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"SilberSternenlicht","description":"I'm a star wars fan and i reeally can't wait to watch the 7th episode <33 So i made a little contribution to my favorite movie <3","medium":null,"title":"The Force is calling for you SilberSternenlicht Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings SilberSternenlicht #crossover #jedi #mlp #mylittlepony #starwars #twilightsparkle #theforceawakens","url":"https:\/\/silbersternenlicht.deviantart.com\/art\/The-Force-is-calling-for-you-577070527\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"TheForceiscallingforyouSilberSternenlichtWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsSilberSternenlichtcrossoverjedimlpmylittleponystarwarstwilightsparkletheforceawakensimage.png","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/silbersternenlicht.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/55e6\/th\/pre\/i\/2015\/343\/d\/0\/the_force_is_calling_for_you_by_silbersternenlicht-d9jkmgv.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"MK01","description":"Arrowhead configuration achieved.

He seriously doesn't recall having murdered anyone! Fun Facts: Most wolves do not divulge their last names to any but family, especially during the five years that they must remain without contact from their parents. They must prove their strength and find their 'pack' (relationships) outside of their family before returning. The majority of pack rituals are no longer practiced since it was believed the wolves evolved to the intelligent state they are in today. Wolves and Canines in this story age slower than humans in our world (and humans do not exist). A 50 year old wolf would be around age 42 for us.

Additionally I wanted to have a trilogy so here's the first part. Since Moon Dancer has two different mane styles in the show, I decided to do at least one picture with both manes. Bonus content for part1: Twilights mane Background story: Part 1: After searching another week through all the books in the Royal Nightmare Library Moon Dancer is confident that she found the right selection of books for the mighty ruler of the night. Now she can face her majesty Nightmare Moon without fear. Every single little doubt disappeared as she reminded herself that she knew all books perfectly well. She cannot just present any selection, it must be perfect. And this is what she has done. Part 2: As we know every ruler need subjects to command at. That's also true for our dark mare of the moon. At this night she ordered Moon Dancer to bring her good books for her entertainment. Tragicly there is a missmatch between Moon Dancer and the royal pony of the night. Full of anger the mighy started to shout at Moon Dancer. >Who do you think am I? \"Advanced Astronomy\"?. I am the queen of the night and I know every star on the firmament.< Moon Dancer wanted to respond with a clear mind but the dark pony just didn't stopped to use her Royal Canterlot Voice. Hours later our pale student was dismissed to leave the room without any words spoken. Part 3: The only cure for that terrible feeling would be a lonely place to cry everything out loudly. Fortunately she knows the castle perfectly well and where to go next. Nopony shall know that Nightmare Moon rejected her again. But unfortunately she only can hope that the next visit will be less depressing.

First of all, I apologize with all the confusion on page 80 (and perhaps making this comic much less interesting). I misread and misunderstood what GashibokA has written, so I ended up translating it incorrectly, turning it into a different story. So it is suppose to be Empress Twilight was worrying about that Crimson Changelings have infiltrated the pony society. So ponies who were accused of being a Crimson Changeling were all captured. (That's why there's the posters) But then Twilight was arresting too many ponies without any solid evidence or whatsoever, so ponies who were against this has formed Resistance against Twilight. I already talked to GashibokA, and he will fix it soon. And there are no major error in translation in previous pages, so don't worry too much about being mislead. Once again, I truly apologizing for almost ruining this amazing story of GashibokA. I'll review my translation and make sure it's quite accurate. I hope you all can enjoy reading this great comic until the end. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you want hear about this comic's news immediately, follow this twitter account.

So, here's my attempt at trying to complete the illusion of a 50s type pinup piece, but with Detresse flair. I did not shine up her top as I usually do, hoping it would give a more retro vibe to the piece. Unlike the previous piece, I used a dark brown for the black parts. I hope you enjoy.

One of many reasons why I enjoy working digitally is that reworking a piece like this is relatively easy, compared to analog art. I simply lasso the portions of the art that I want to remove, hit \"delete\", use the eraser tool to fine-tune the deletion, and add color to the portions covered by Tetsuko's fingers. I also edited Sonya's eyes so that she's looking at you (with that smile that seems to ask \"you like what you see?\"), and added a new background. Doing all this with real-world materials would have involved redrawing or retracing the art, which would've involved hours of work - and color? Fuggeddaboudit! I couldn't work in color if not for software like SmithMicro's Manga Studio EX 5, or Adobe Photoshop (although I'm using MS5EX for about 99.5% of my work these days).

When her planet was under attack by a Mutilon Invasion, The Galacta-Force intervened and helped her people to defeat them. Impressed by her fighting capabilities Galacta-Force asked her to join their organization which she accepted very willingly. PERSONAL DATA Characteristics: Â· Species: Thaesssian (Humanoid) Â· Age: 131 Â· Height: 6\u20195\u201D Â· Weight: 206lbs Â· Eye Color: Cyan Â· Hair Color: Yellowish Green Â· Skin Color: Pale Yellow Status Â· Place of Birth: Ekos Â· Citizenship: None Â· Rank: Sub Enforcer Â· Base: Ixion Interceptor, Galactor Prime (Galacta-Force Headquarters) Â· Occupation: Adventurer Â· Known Relatives: Rokk (Father), Yura Val (Mother), Gazi Mo (Younger Brother), Teraki (Grandmother), Vero (Uncle) POWERS AND ABILITIES Power Grid Â· Intelligence: 3 Â· Strength: 6 Â· Speed: 2 Â· Durability: 7 Â· Energy Projection: 3 Â· Fighting Skills: 6 Elemental Mimicry: she has the ability to transform her body completely into the fundamental elements of air, earth, electricity, fire, light, shadow and water. She can transform into homogenous matter, without any part of her form being more important than the other. Elemental Shapeshifting: She can transform\/reshape her form to enhance her body for combat using some surrounding elements. Enhanced Stamina: Her Thaessian physiology allows her to function for long periods of time without tiring or straining herself. Enhanced Durability: In her earth form her body is extremely durable making her almost immune to physical attack. Enhanced Strength: her strength is increased tenfold when she is in her earth form and is able to lift over 30tons easily. Enhanced Agility: she has the ability to go from one motion to another effortlessly, effectively dodge attacks, swing from things easily, sprint, do back-flips and numerous other gymnastic, athletic and martial implements with little effort. Oxygen Independence: Gayas has no need for oxygen, allowing her to survive indefinitely in airless environments. LIMITATIONS Â· She can only mimic substances she can touch Â· She can only transform into one element at a time, and she must first return back to her normal form before changing to another element. Â· Her abilities are greatly limited when in a vacuum such as deep space. SKILLS Thanks to her upbringing she has total mastery of her abilities and is able to defend herself in hand to hand combat. She is also able to perceive the terrain of her immediate surroundings on any planet she is on, making her an excellent Navigator. PARAPHERNALIA Her suit is composed of smart molecules which changes into the exact atomic structure her body mimics into along with kinetic barriers to shield against energy and projectile based weaponry and can generate its own life support field when in deep space. PERSONALITY Gayas has a very vibrant, expansive personality that is free like a bird. She is very positive and optimistic in any situation. She is spontaneous and adventurous and loves to be were the action is. Despite her spontaneous personality she is very smart and is capable of understanding complex things. She relates well with others and is well liked because of her encouraging positive nature and her kind heart. But there are times when she can be reckless and irresponsible because she will jump immediately into battle without a battle plan or strategy or fail to follow orders and protocol. She gets incredibly bored with so much formality but tries her best to make herself a useful team player. She has a deep desire to explore the vast reaches of space, go on exciting and thrilling adventures and do her best to make the Universe a safer place for all life.","medium":null,"title":"Gayas (Revised) CAPTAIN-GAMMA Watch Cartoons & Comics Digital Media Cartoons Drawings CAPTAIN-GAMMA #aliens #digital #illustration #princess #art #amazonwarrior #conceptart #originalcharacter #originalcharacters #superheroine #superpowers (show more)","url":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/art\/Gayas-Revised-683748131\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Cartoons & Comics","Digital Media","Cartoons","Drawings"],"filename":"GayasRevisedCAPTAINGAMMAWatchCartoonsComicsDigitalMediaCartoonsDrawingsCAPTAINGAMMAaliensdigitalillustrationprincessartamazonwarriorconceptartoriginalcharacteroriginalcharacterssuperheroinesuperpowersshowmoreimage.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/captain-gamma.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/a369\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/151\/1\/4\/gayas__revised__by_captain_gamma-dbb33fn.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," White"],"artist":"y2jenn","description":"I wanted to do somethin for Valentine's Day that wasn't something i've done before.

Just tell me what you think would look better or that I should work on. ______________________ Inspired by this, by the way~ Speedpaint Video will be updated on here soon...and my page I think ^^ Hope you enjoy this!

Since I said that patrons could see my work earlier on Patreon than on deviantART, I think that promise means more if I wait a week or two between posting something there and here, but considering the holiday-specific nature of this piece, I hope my patrons will understand if I upload it a little earlier. I went on a bit about what a pain backgrounds are when I uploaded my last piece, and people in the comments said that the extra work is worthwhile and encouraged me to continue putting effort into them, so it's ironic that the background is completely invisible in this one.

To Aztec- But as soon as we did, everything fell into place, her look, her tattoo, her outfits, and even her dragon- the Quetzalcoatl. Quetza as she is called as the Orsian God of Wind. Eagle's true name is Izel, but nicknamed Eagle, for her incredible eyesight, her powers that make her almost fly, and the ginormous eagle tattoo covering her chest. Eagle's personality however, has not changed one bit. She's one of the less serious characters, brings a heavy dose of comedy in the story along with a few other characters. Playing mind games, pranks on both friend and foe and loves to jump into battle with the bad puns and one-liners. She's a tormentor within the group, pranks in the variety on her favorite targets: Silver and Nola. ( She does prank the others, but they deliver weak reactions compared to those two. However, she does not prank Cerridwen, for obvious reasons, and Kat- She has tried to, but Kat somehow knows every time) And because of her pranking nature, she has the most 'trollish' face when she's up to no good. I honestly won't be surprised if she becomes and Icon for it... Beyond the fun and games, Eagle's a very well established fighter. She's extremely light on her feet (the woman can squat) balancing on her toes and balls of her feet. Manipulating the force and velocity of wind can make her nearly soundless and weightless to her foes, but when directing her powers upon her enemies, that same weightless air can switch into gale force winds tossing her foes high in the air ( or tossing them through concrete) to deadly torrential\/ hurricane force. What aids her in her battle is her Bladed 'Tonfans'. I spent days agonizing how these would look and thanks to my partner in crime and Editor, we were able to create these badboys. Painted in the colors of the Quetzalcoatl, and the carved head of the Quetzalcoatl on the end. Eagle's changes has made me come to absolutely LOVE the use of Aztec colors and designs, and... I really want her pants... Working on her expression sheet next. Troll face will be included. It's nice to finally achieve something after a full 4 day drawing block. Eagle Â©2013 THE ELEMENTS.

FOR HILUM! ~Hilum wanted a print of the Moo Moo deviation, unfortunately then, I couldn't accept Pay Pal money since they don't have Pay Pal in the Philippines yet. Hilum then surprised me one day with a Prints Account! 0___0 which made me so surprised BUT so thankful and excited as well. YES! Now I have a Prints Account! So I re-did the Moo Moo Deviation so I can submit a better quality, and turn this into a print just as ~Hilum wanted. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart (incase you weren't able to read the Journal Entry I wrote about this heehee). Prints Prints for this deviation will be available shortly.

This is the 4th time I've drawn Sonya and this time ReddofNonnac trusted me with the markers. I've been really getting into the marker drawings lately, just don't get enough damn time to do more! (I know, I know - I'm bitching about not having any time again) The brief was to do a cheesecake pin-up of her showing off her impossible strength... in a bikiini. I won't lie, I really struggled with this to start with. I had a tough time coming up with an idea that was sexy and impossibly strong whilst keeping it convincing. I'm also a bit of a nightmare in the sense that I like to have a bit of exposition for a pic, so in my head I was thinking, \"How do I explain a giantess working out in a bikini using something that shows how incredibly strong she is?\" But then I remembered that not many pin-ups need explaining! There's not many photos of women in bikinis from a studio shoot that have an elaborate back story so after I realised I was being daft I eventually got round to coming up with something decent! Those of you in the know will probably recognise the pose. I found a pic of 90's fbb Denise Rutkowski and thought that it would make an awesome pin-up with a little bit of tweaking. I swapped the dumbbell for a wrecking ball, adjusted the figure a little here and there and replaced her head with Sonya's. This pic was done on 350gsm card using Warm and Cool Grey Copic markers, Pigma Micron and Pitt Pens, White Gel pen and black and white pencil crayon. The copics and the pencils give a very nice soft look to the art but drawing and shading muscle is pretty damn time consuming!

Involves another time for the Rainbooms and their Pets to come together for pictures for Animal Calendar. They convinced the Turtles and Human Allies to bring forth their own pets to share this tradition. This is 1 of 4 Designs Leonardo (TMNT 2012) and his new pet Akita Dog, Yoshi (TMNT 2012) Twilight Sparkle (MLP EG 2015) and her companion, Spike The Dog (MLP EG 2015) Karai Hamato (TMNT 2012) with her new pet snake, Shen (TMNT 2013) Note: The Akita Dog and The Snake are really confirmed from the TMNT 2012, but anything could happen in the Equestria Ninja Fic World The Akita Dog, Hachiko was former pet dog belonging to the Shredder. But after Shredder was slain, the dog fend for himself, out in the streets searching for food and shelter. It wasn't very long until he was discovered by April and Casey whom somehow show compassion to the dog and then had an idea. They know that the three turtles, Raph, Donnie and Mikey have their own pets, either mutant or alien, it would seem fitting that Leo should have his own pet. Thus entering the Akita Dog. It did not take long for the dog to have his loyalty\/allegiance change to Leo, for the two share a common bond, fighting for honor and peace. And it did not take Leo to figure a name for the dog, none other than his Master\/Father (Hamato Yoshi). There fore Yoshi is the name for the Akita Dog. The two are in sync. The Snake was one of the other snakes that were in the cage from Shredder's plan to use Karai as bait to lure Splinter and the Turtles from hiding, have them captured and turn them into mindless snake mutants. Unfortunetly the plan backfired and end up turning Karai into her Snake Mutant. When the area was caught on fire, the Snakes have escaped and fled somewhere in the city. Eventually the one snake had slithered to Former Shredder's hideout, now belonging to Karai as she restores order to the Foot Ninja Clan. Karai discovered this lonesome snake and senses, the snake is a she and is very lonesome. It was long before Karai decided to take her in and consider her a pet.

Added bubbles to spice up the moment Leo on thought: Come on Leo! Go for it! What are you afraid of?

Added bubbles to spice up the moment Leo on thought: Come on Leo! Go for it! What are you afraid of? Twilight in thought: Maybe I should make the first move (giggle) KISSING Leo in thought: Ok...that was worth the wait Twilight: Merry Christmas Leo Leo: Merry Christmas Twilight Another time when the Ninja Group went back to Equestria with Sunset to visit Princess Twilight and her friends as they were setting up for Hearts Warming. As all were enjoying themselves, once again Leo and Princess Twilight were caught under the Mistletoe and embrace the moment. Leo in thought: Turtle up dude and kiss her! Princess Twilight in thought: I can see he is about as nervous as I am KISSING (With song playing from Samurai Jack Season 5 as Jack and Ashi kissed) Princess Twilight: Happy Hearts Warming Leo Leo: Happy Hearts Warming Twilight Note: This is my final design piece til we hit 2018.

I've putted all my heart and soul in this story. Humor, sadness, love, happyness, anger and creativity. I'm proud to say that I finally finished this. There have been times that I thought...Iquit. But then, I remembered...why I am doing this. Why I'm making this. I'm trying to safe the sharks. But when you're trying to safe sharks, you're trying to safe all of us. Like Susan the blacktip reef shark said in the comic, we can't live without sharks. They keep the ocean in balance. And if not, then we would die too. With this story, I want to make people laugh, cry and let them realize what we're doing. What we're doing wrong and how we can solve it. How we can protect the ocean. And how to love sharks. But Jack's journey is not over. The sharks journey, is never over. The shark has been here, for 450 million years...I want them to keep moving. I want them to keep us alive. Sharks will always be...ontop. Thank you for reading this. Enjoy!

This is another, although I want to keep this one around as long as possible. You all already know of my love for the pairing of ParkerxSparkle, but where does my love for Luna stand? Pretty high up, really. She's my third favorite character in Friendship is Magic behind Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle. In Spiders and Magic, it's hinted that she's enamored with Peter, but where do her feelings really stand? Read the links below to find out. If you're not interested, it's fine.

I felt like trying out the style they use since it\u2019s so cute~ And I may try this with other artists in the future too. it\u2019s a fantastic learning experience and it\u2019s always good to try new things.
