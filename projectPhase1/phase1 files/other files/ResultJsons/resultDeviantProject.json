For now I shall sleep and recharge my brains. UPDATE: Yet another cheesy title ><; I made some changes in the background and my signature. Fixed the trees a bit and engraved my signature in the wood instead of just putting it there. Had a lot ups and downs with this drawing. Made a lot of revisions during the process (well more the usual ). I even experienced some artist block in between so this took longer to finish than the first two.

And LOVE is the best thing that can ever happen to us. So I won't exclude anybody from my love because of their gender, origin or sexual orientation. Everyone is worth to be loved! We are all one before God. A D D M Y F A C E B O O K P A G E S: Personal Page Lilyas Art Page Lilyas Fanclub The Chromatic Deck Playing Cards The Pure Mandala This is my official submission to DeviantArt's Pride Month Project. I hope you like the spiritually themed mandala. I have chosen the color orange from the Pride flag. This color is associated with the meaning of HEALING. There is still so much healing necessary in terms of the LGBTQ+ community. I strongly support this kind of healing work though I don't especially consider myself as part of LGBTQ+. I understand that many people fight for their rights to be what they feel they are but I myself don't have issues with my gender identity or sexual orientation. If you ask me in what way I identify myself I will tell you this: There is no label for my way of being. I am not simply bisexual or heterosexual or whatever - I am just SEXUAL. I am sexual being that is open to make sexual experiences of all kind. I don't prefer any kind of special men or women while others I have aversion for. If you have an open heart I am able to love you no matter if you are old or young, tall or short, big or slim, black or white, where you are coming from and what you have done. No matter who you are - I want to encourage you go for that what comes from your heart. Don't let anyone prevent you from being what you are and doing what you heart tells you is right - even when they judge you and segregate you for that. It's better to be hated for what you are than loved for what you are not. Other spiritual works © Copyright by Lily A. Seidel 2017. All rights reserved.

I know that the chapter is trying to make the nature of the spawn ambiguous as to whether it is an ally or a foe, but I dunno. I wanted to draw a horrible monster fish. Besides, who's to say that just because it looks awful, means that it's a bad guy, you know?

All submissions must adhere to DeviantArt\u2019s normal Terms of Service and Etiquette standards.(I didn't really want to put too much time into this drawing due to how many commissions I have to finish...so I finished this in about 4 hours) I couldn't help but think of frisk for the figure head lines, and Gaster's hands for, well, the hands! I had a hard time trying to fit other Undertale characters into the other lines, but after looking at images of them for a while, I remembered Gaster's Followers! Perfect fit! That 'butterfly' figure was a pain to figure out what to do with it, but the heart locket was best suited for it's heart-shape. At first, it was going to be 2 souls, but I like the locket better. Overall, it looks like Frisk had fun with Gaster and his followers. I'm glad that it didn't turn out to be a tormenting feel with all of them around Frisk. And look at who's at the door waiting for Frisk, Sans! I hope everyone likes it. All of my watchers are my tags!! Go give this challenge a try! It's fun!

STOP THE BULLY!!!! ______ Just thought I'd contribute and raise the awareness that this shit happens. It pisses me off that people do this; dehumanization, heartlessness, hate, intolerance, inflicting pain. Seeing kids with empty faces while their eyes scream in distress and suffering. The hopelessness... the bruises, the blood. Their death in the newspaper and on TV. Bullying doesn't have to be physical but mental too. The kid may give you a stonewall face but his eyes will speak and waver and show you his\/her heart is broken. if you see the bullying take place.... bah, punch his face! Some people deserve a smack. And THEN tell a person of authority. The people who witness these acts and do nothing also need a punch cuz, to me, they're just as bad for not giving a shit. THATS how I feel about it. Okay for the sake of being serious, don't punch the bully but tell somebody, like the teacher, principal, security, etc., to reprimand them. And pull the victim to the mall with you and buy him\/her dinner. But if you don't like them to help them because of some stupid reason like they're gay, then you need a punch too. edit: Cleaned up the sketch lines a little, but not by much.

I started in 2005, so this would be my fourth card. Previous cards featured my characters from Trio Solution and yours truly. This year, I thought it was about time to go with something a little bit more generic. The obvious choice was Santa Claus, the generic personification of the holiday season. Sure, I could had done something with Jesus or something, but I'm sure that some of the recipients would be kind of weided out, to say at least. I started out with Santa as a UPS delivery man, but I just couldn't get it right. After a few tries, I decided to try a different angle and thought \"instead of making him lame, why not make him awesome\". So I did.

Inside you feel the lightweight traveling size book. It is neatly wrapped in the waterproof leather. It is held closed with a stunning amethyst clasp with a silver unicorn buckle. Loosening the buckle, you allow the case to fall from the beautiful book. The book is a fine and well-crafted. Bound in gleaming white leather and adorned with a silver unicorn on the cover, it displays the script \"Tirael Nimara\" in the delicate script of the elves. You softly open the book, inside, you see the perfect, measured writing of a trained hand. Soon, you begin to read....... ******************** Light. Blindness. Soon, the light spreads its wings from my sight and I find myself in strange yet beautiful surroundings. I am pale and nude, wavering in a moonlight path, open only on one end. I feel as though I am only a simple observer in my own body. To either side of the path, lies thick tangled bramble and huge darkened trees. Farther down the wandering path is a large open area filled with pale moonlight which is guarded by a unicorn archway. On either side of the opening rear two unicorn stallions crafted of white marble. They have delicately crafted marble wings lifted and spread to make an archway into the glade. Their alicorns are crossed and are balancing a pentagram between the horn\u2019s points. I feel so safe and serene that I am aghast with joy. I pass under the shelter of the unicorn\u2019s arch. Inside the magnificent glade I gasp in joy. Ethereal light, pale and multihued, dances in the huge spreading treetops above. The sound of tumbling water tickles my ears. I smell the joyous scent of flowers. I know despite my nudity, I can feel no vulnerability in this place. There are motes of light in all different colors, lights and shades that dart and dance within my reach. Purple, blue, black and red flowers of all hues glow from the ground, bushes and trees. The peacefulness of this realm permeates me. I walk over to the tumbling water fall. I see it is pouring into a clear, sparkling lake. The bushes are laden with many colored flowers that hug the sides of the water. Lichen and mosses drip from the overhanging tress and willows, their trailings dancing long the surface of water. Inside the water, tiny multicolored fish, frogs, lizards and fairies dart for deeper water. The water ripples to the other side. A flash of light draws my attention. I stare in awe as I see a shimmering white unicorn walk from the brush. She doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge me. She walks into the water, her body moving into the lake. She stops. She lowers the shining horn into the water and it begins to ripple as silver streaks stream from her horn. It is a great mare with a flowing silver-blue mane, glistening violet horn and sharp cloven hooves. She was more beautiful than any other horse I had ever seen. From her back were shining iridescent wings. Each feather looked like spun silver, it was so delicate and perfect. It was wonderful. I was so happy! Then she approached me. It moved its wings over my back, hugging me. It was so splendid! Then it told me that I would always be one with Unicorn. Then the unicorn lowered her sharp horn to my heart and she pressed the sparkling shaft to me. I felt the most powerful energy flow into me. I gasped in pleasure as the power coursed and doubled into my body. I could barely maintain my balance. Suddenly, the unicorn took a step back. Then she rose a little, drawing the alicorn to my forehead. I gasped at the exquisite rippling of pleasure bursting within. Then she drew herself back. Spiraling from where my forehead was touched by her horn, my own horn grew in response!!! I was shocked and could do no more than stand there still as a statue. Suddenly the unicorn flared out her wings and the tips of her feathers tingled along my back. My spine flared with energy. She moved her wings away from my back. Pleasure streamed from me as my own feathers were following his! I had wings!! Oh my Unicorn! She then took a step back. I was in shock! Here I stood with my own shining white-violet horn. My own wings spread out beside me! It was so amazing. Then the unicorn looked down at me. She softly said \u201CI am with you. You can always call upon me and my allies for help and guidance. You should always look to us for help.\u201D The unicorn took a step back and she trumpeted a great whinny that echoed for miles. From all areas I saw a menagerie of horses, unicorns, deer, elk, dogs, cats, pegasi and more animals than I could possibly name or know. The area was filled with their energy. A glowing blue light filled the area and I knew\u2026for once\u2026that the blessings of the unicorn were with me. When I awoke I still felt the power of the animals surging within me. I know that the Unicorn was blessing me because of the crystalline, milky violet horn on my forehead and the tumbling white hair. My hair had quite literally turned white! Art Creation Notes: Year Completed: 2009 (Pencil sketch done in 2006) Time it Took: Pencil took several hours, I think three or four devoted hours then a few scattered throughout. Medium: Pencil Original Size: 8x10Inches (YES IT IS VERY SMALL, I regret this, because the unicorn and moon dominate the entire piece of paper. As it was, It was a lot of detail for so small an area. And Abathia, as a unicorn, was not made to regret, so she doesn't mind the small format *hehe, dorky Last Unicorn joke*) Source\/Model: No Source Notes: I wanted a good picture for a role playing game god. I use her in D&D. OK. So, this is a colored version of pegacorna2.deviantart.com\/art\/\u2026 that has been completed. Hehe. You know, I only sign a piece I feel is completely and utterly finished. This piece was laying around unsigned for years. I knew I wanted to do the back wing, but I never throught I was ready. My coloring skills have pretty much been to build up to this one. Drawn in pencil, here is the WIP Pencil sketch: pegacorna2.deviantart.com\/art\/\u2026 and I then colored it in prismacolor marker and pencil. The markers gave a really soft watercolored effect and the pencil really makes the picture \"pop\" I got the purplish prismatic color by layering colors then going over the whole thing with a white colored pencil. No marker was used on Abathia herself, only on the background.

If you need this image in a larger size, please let me know! As I am selling prints, I have set it to not allow downloads of the large original image! ----- Lysanna felt a sudden change in her breathing, and knew than [sic] that something had happened to her Progeny. Submission for Odyssey Project II chapter 3 (runner up). Super fun to work on this chapter. I actually took some time and really tried to do a proper painting, instead of merely laying down some random color as a background for my lines. Painting and color palette choice are weaknesses for me, which I am aware of. Taking this into consideration, I think I did a good job. Which is why it's a shame that it didn't scan properly... Usually I use hot pressed paper, which has a smooth texture, and it scans beautifully. In fact the scans look better than the originals, I find! But I'm running out of it, so I used cold pressed paper which has a much rougher texture. The rough texture messes with the scanner lights, and it never scans as nicely, no matter what settings I fool around with. A lot of subtle detail gets lost in the scan. And I didn't have the time or motivation or skill to photograph it. Too busy this weekend. I'm hoping that you all still like it. After all, you don't have the original to compare it to! (I see that I suddenly have been given a premium membership for one month, so I am \"requesting critique\" for this deviation. I welcome critiques on all my work. I miss the in-depth, unflinching crits I used to get while in art school. One detailed explanation of something you don't like and how you would fix it is SO MUCH more useful than a million short \"I like this!\" comments. Not that I don't appreciate those too, of course. Just feel free to tell me what's not working. How else am I supposed to get better?)

The disease is commonly connected to the term of \u0091forgetful-ness\u0092 the disease of the mind. What makes it so destructive is not just that they forget to brush their teeth or when to have dinner- but they forget who they love. I have three grandparents who are suffering from dementia, and I\u0092ve watched my parents struggle with dealing with someone who they care for so much; not recall who they are. The subject I have here is my grandmother. I have shown this mental distance by having the head canvas floating further away from her body, her past and physical presence not understood in her present state. Although this is a key aspect of dementia, what I really wanted to show was that in fact, the victim isn\u0092t the only one who forgets. It\u0092s the people who care about them, too. I know when I was a kid, I used to visit my grandmother once every week; and she\u0092d baby sit me when I was sick. She\u0092d read me stories and play card games. Although I know that she used to be the person she was then, all I can remember of her now is what I see now; unstable, unrecognisable and in an almost child-like state. And I feel guilty, for forgetting who she really is. Because all I see now is a physical existence, but not being completely present anymore; not really being my grandmother anymore. I demonstrated this by painting her body onto an actual rocking chair. Although her body is visible, the very person who it depicts is no longer 'real'. Featured: [link] EDIT: Oh gosh, a DD! I'm speechless! Thank you all so much for your support- and I hope that all of you with personal experiences with the disease have things turn out for the best.

Thank you so much! This character design is two years old, though. If you would like to see his new design and be updated on the comic he's in, watch my main account: =temporary-glitch. Thank you so, so much, and Merry Christmas to everyone! Biography Name: Peppermint Nicknames: Santa, Nicholas Eye color: Green Hair color: Red and white Height: 5'5\" Companions: Licorice, Truffles, Egg Nogg, Punch, Cider, Candy-Ribbon, Cocoa, Tea, Caramel, Ginger, Cinnamon, Popcorn, Chestnut, Cranberry Occupation: Defender of Christmas and neighboring holidays; annual gift-giver Appearance: Is usually wearing bright, festive colors. His skin is very pale and his cheeks and nose, ears on occasion, are always bright and rosy. He always has his candy cane with him, which he carved himself from a branch of the Ornamin tree. On the very end is a green gemstone his father, the real Santa Claus, gave him to enable teleporation between Earth and Christmas Land. The object that holds the real power, however, is embedded deeply within that stone; a golden star. Somewhere on the giant candy cane is a switch that removes almost all of the top part of the candy cane, save for about two feet from the green gem up, revealing a red and white striped sword. Personality and Accomplishments: He is very happy and charitable, always thinking of others before himself. This attribute makes way for an uncommon selflessness that usually gets Peppermint in trouble. He is very innocent and bright, and is usually managing the toy factory for his father, helping his fellow elves come up with ideas for new toys. He can't keep a grudge--either he confronts someone himself and tries to compromise with them, or he writes them a nice letter, and waits for a reply. Peppermint is currently learning how to be a true Defender of Holiday, but he isn't doing very well, unlike his schoolmates...he seems as though he's far too innocent to fight. He loves Christmas and snow, and can't get enough of that ice-cream stuff. He hates hot and spicy things. Along with his learning, he often aids his father in delivering gifts to the children on Christmas day. The kids that do catch a glimpse of him mistake his pale white chest as a long beard, and his puffy pants as a big belly. How they got all that red in the mix, he just can't seem to figure out. ;3 --- *Pant koff.* I caught myself a lovely cold in the making of this image...and maybe now my cold will go away, and I can work on commissions and art trade halves and everything else I piled up on myself! Anyway, this is what my icon and journal header were made from...the new-and-improved design of the little Christmas angel, Peppermint. More designs are soon to come, like Licorice and Punch and the gang! Also, I'll make a comparison picture tomorrow. Once I sleep. *Goes and dies.* Sketched with a col-erase red pencil on sketchbook paper. Then scanned and inked in Photoshop CS2, and colored in openCanvas 3.03E Plus!.

I chose him to be the LGBT's presidential candidate for this parody on the Obama Pride poster. Fitting. Click download for the full-sized, 2'x3' poster. Print it out and use it if you'd like! UPDATE: I've been getting messages regarding wether or not this image can be used in this blog\/that magazine\/ my website\/ etc. I don't really check my messages here very often, and if you desperately want to display this on one of the above places (or any I left out), please feel free. Do NOT feel free to claim it as your own, as I will nut you if you do. But seriously, this image is telling a message, and that message should be available freely. Basically, from here on out, you don't need to ask permission to use this for non commercial purposes, unless specifically crediting me as the original artist. Thank you all for the wonderful feedback and love for this image!","medium":null,"title":"PRIDE connorlassey Watch Community Projects Awareness 2009 Gay & Lesbian Pride connorlassey","url":"https:\/\/connorlassey.deviantart.com\/art\/PRIDE-136017924\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2009","Gay & Lesbian Pride"],"filename":"PRIDE connorlassey Watch Community Projects Awareness 2009 Gay & Lesbian Pride connorlassey_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/connorlassey.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/494f\/th\/pre\/i\/2009\/248\/f\/2\/pride_by_connorlassey.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," White"],"artist":"ForestGirl","description":"For Red Addiction contest by marvelousmanips.deviantart.com\u2026 Model - combination twilitesmuse.deviantart.com\/ar\u2026 + twilitesmuse.deviantart.com\/ar\u2026 (for legs) + twilitesmuse.deviantart.com\/ar\u2026 (for dress) Other stock - rezzan.deviantart.com\/art\/My-i\u2026 www.shutterstock.com\/pic.mhtml\u2026 maureenolder.deviantart.com\/ar\u2026 Before\/after - forestgirl.deviantart.com\/art\/\u2026 Like it: The photomanipulation art in my gallery is copyrighted © Julia Popova \/ForestGirl\/.

Though, Cadence is pink by definition... ah well. For the piece itself I tried to use a heart motif, subtly, in the shapes of their hair and necks, eyes, etc. Also I wanted everything to be as soft as possible in terms of shading, expression, and magic. Hope you enjoy \"everypony\"! As always, let me know what you think.","medium":null,"title":"Mi Amore Shining Hearts MirrorandImage Watch Community Projects Holidays 2014 Valentine Exchange MirrorandImage","url":"https:\/\/mirrorandimage.deviantart.com\/art\/Mi-Amore-Shining-Hearts-432516185\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Holidays","2014","Valentine Exchange"],"filename":"Mi Amore Shining Hearts MirrorandImage Watch Community Projects Holidays 2014 Valentine Exchange MirrorandImage_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/mirrorandimage.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/2fcd\/th\/pre\/i\/2014\/038\/8\/b\/mi_amore_shining_hearts_by_mirrorandimage-d75ibmh.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," White"],"artist":"StephanieSmall","description":"Yin Yang STEPHANIE SMALL ARTIST AND ACTRESS stephanie@clipclopworkshop.com * Clip Clop Workshop WITH YOU I FELT THE TIDE: Poetry and Fantasy Art, an E-Book Artist Info Commission Info * Contest Info Trades\/Gifts to Me! * Trades\/Gifts from Me!

Also called Vu Quang ox. This is a rare mammal and it is critically endangered. Only four Saola have been documented in the wild as of today. Often called the Asian Unicorn, this rare and elusive creature is as difficult to find as the creature they are nicknamed after. In May 1992, the Saola was discovered in north-central Vietnam. A unique skull was found in a hunter\u2019s cache. Each Saola (male and female) has two, long straight, 20-inch horns. They are cousins to cattle despite looking like antelope. They have bright, white markings on their face. These rare beings are found only in the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. Their name means \"spinning wheel posts\" and is probably related to the size and shape of the horns.

I'm a sucker for those things! The only problem is Valentines Day is kinda a sick joke to me right now. The thing is, due to recent... boy issues I've completely rejected personal romance. It was a mix of sadness and anger, but the worst part is, we never dated, heck, he never knew I liked him, so I feel I have no right to feel mad at him for breaking my heart. After I mentally gave up, I realized my passion for romance and emotion (with was a very strong quality) was gone. My day dream about finding love were replaced by complete indifference. Adults kept reminding me that I am only 15, but they don't realize what a complete 360 my emotions went through. Even my love of shipping took a dip. Anyway, sorry for the monologue, I usually don't ever let my feelings interfere with my art work, since my main goal is to entertain watchers, but I couldn't bring myself do a puff piece. My original plan was to do something humerus of me throwing Cupid in a trash compactor, but since I'v had Prisoner\/Paper Airplanes on a loop for the entire day last half hour, i decided to just go with my gut and do something out and out depressing and hope I'm not the only one who gotta bone to pick with St. Valentine. Happy signal awareness day!

Hope he's scarier now! - Halloween being one of my favorite holidays, and Sauron being one of my favorite Legendarium characters, I had no choice but to draw him as Annatar doing his evil, human sacrificing witch-doctor style. Technique The shading is all traditional, with only a bit tune-up of the contrast in PS, but no digital touch-ups at all. I used mainly 2B-6B pencils and q-tip and finger smudging to make the detailed shading. I always forget how fun this technique actually is. Is it very easy and rather quick compared to doing cross-hatchings with hard pencils, which is my usual go-to technique. Idea It was an idea that just popped into my head a few weeks ago, and thus being one of the quickest and most detailed drawings I've made in months, with 20-25hours of work. I was inspired by voodoo witch-doctors, which is something that really freaks me out. I've always been intrigued by the skull-facepaint but never gotten to do it, so this was a two-in-one idea, really. It sprung from the story of Sauron Annatar (I dont really know if he called himself Annatar while he had his fun with Numenor, I didnt find a specification, but I really like that name for him in that period, so I just go for that) as he sacrifices humans to Morgoth in Valinor (hence the screaming faces in the smoke) and I always pictured him kind of like a witch-doctor, mad and beautiful while corrupting the hearts of men. I could've put more thought into his costume, but I really didn't bother with all the shading I had to do, I hope you can forgive me. (And no he is not naked, he is wearing a skirt with a birdskull on the belt, as you can see.) All in all I am very happy with him, even though I know the anatomy is a bit off. It is always like that with my A4 pieces, I cannot for the life of me understand why, but the proportions are all distorted when I work in that format. I have to find out why.. I hope you like him, and HAPPY HALLOWEEN!! Cheers, Iggy PS. everyone be safe! pps. Oh and yes that is a necklace with human eyes on it, because obviously Sauron would be collecting the eyes of his victims. That much is obvious...","medium":null,"title":"Silmarillion - Witch-doctor Annatar IngvildSchageArt Watch Community Projects Holidays Recurring Halloween IngvildSchageArt #halloween #sauron #silmarillion #tolkien #witchdoctor #annatar #mairon","url":"https:\/\/ingvildschageart.deviantart.com\/art\/Silmarillion-Witch-doctor-Annatar-643278063\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Holidays","Recurring","Halloween"],"filename":"Silmarillion - Witch-doctor Annatar IngvildSchageArt Watch Community Projects Holidays Recurring Halloween IngvildSchageArt #halloween #sauron #silmarillion #tolkien #witchdoctor #annatar #mairon_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$62.21","artistURL":"https:\/\/ingvildschageart.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/bf94\/i\/2016\/350\/3\/4\/silmarillion___witch_doctor_annatar_by_ingvildschageart-damzoj3.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"leamatte","description":".","medium":null,"title":"Hungry cat leamatte Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella leamatte","url":"https:\/\/leamatte.deviantart.com\/art\/Hungry-cat-293625356\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Community Projects","Projects","Free Fella"],"filename":"Hungry cat leamatte Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella leamatte_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/leamatte.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/5047\/i\/2012\/092\/d\/e\/hungry_cat_by_aemiliana-d4uterw.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"lesley-oldaker","description":"oil on canvas, 109x107cm,","medium":null,"title":"Waiting lesley-oldaker Watch Community Projects Projects Odyssey Project Clive Barker Chapter 6 Artwork","url":"https:\/\/lesley-oldaker.deviantart.com\/art\/Waiting-340001381\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Community Projects","Projects","Odyssey Project","Clive Barker","Chapter 6","Artwork"],"filename":"Waiting lesley-oldaker Watch Community Projects Projects Odyssey Project Clive Barker Chapter 6 Artwork_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$62.83","artistURL":"https:\/\/lesley-oldaker.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/b556\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/332\/b\/8\/waiting_by_lesley_oldaker-d5mfeqt.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"Tiny-Forest-Prince","description":"\"bloodied knuckles, but im not dead\" so I decided to take part in deviantarts pride contest!

If you need this image in a larger size, please let me know! As I am selling prints, I have set it to not allow downloads of the large original image! ----- He would see to it that their world would never threaten his, or any other, planet again. Submission for the Odyssey Project chapter 8. Odyssey is over! What a project it has been. I have some thoughts that I will turn into a journal entry, soon. What I liked about the last chapter was the sense that the story didn't end there. Whatever-Paul-Is-Now has defeated the immediate threat, but there is the sense that this is just the beginning for him. So this feeling is what I focused on for my last illustration. Whatever-Paul-Is-Now, triumphant over the remains of the monster, with the vast possibilities of space before him. I know that this visual is slightly different than what is described in the story; I have said this before, I'm really not interested in making an illustration that is a literal, completely accurate, visual representation of what is happening in the words. I think that good illustration transcends mere \"illustration\" and becomes art, and something that can communicate its own ideas, when it is a more figurative representation, not constrained by trying to make sure that every detail matches. ... is my excuse. I just really really wanted to draw a mean old fish skull. This illustration is my visual take on the famous romantic painting Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog. [link] (did you recognize it? did you pay attention in art history class?) I love this painting and the feelings it evokes. I had used it once before in a previous project which was much less successful. I am hoping this time that you will feel that I did this classic painting justice.

I wanted to do it for a very long time \u0096 but now I found the right quote and the right time to do it. It is nothing special \u0096 only the quote is amazing and needs to be shared. For sure, it is also a little bit of an hommage to Steve Jobs. But not only for what he invented, but more for how brave he was while looking into the face of death. He gives us a great lesson about what life really is with this quote. Comments are very appreciated. You are also allowed to download this and use it personally. EDIT: I changed the quotation marks to the english ones. I am a german native speaker and our quotation marks look like this \u0084\u0093 But this is an english quote, there is nothing german in this, so they were wrong. Now I used the english marks.

My policy is that you note me to make arrangements. If you are leasing one of my mares, you draw the breeding picture and foal. If you are using one of my studs and approach me, you are drawing the breeding picture and foal. I have the right to refuse any breeding, but don't take it personal For stud\/lease Openings: There are three slots open at any given time for this horse. Slots open as breedings are completed. Personality: Shy, elusive and hard to find. History: Raised in the Heart of Tir'Rielle, a magical island where equines rule. Residence\/Home: Tir'Rielle Island. This animal lives on Tir'Rielle a magical island where my Stable in the Horseart Game resides. Tir'Rielle is an enchanted stable that dominates a tiny floating temperate forest island. It usually lies within a great mist, far in the unknown places, but it travels where it needs to in order to make its precious animals available to meet other equines. It is a magical island that shifts from place to place wherever it is needed. The island is actually a series of volcanoes with its center an equine paradise. The border of the island is a thick layer of mist. Tir'Rielle is a thick forest with steaming warm hot pools, some waterfalls, crystals growing like plants from the ground and strange lights from fae that reside throughout the forest. The island's mistress is Tariel, a powerful shapeshifter and druidess. Normal animals talk, faeries flit all over and unicorns reside in the dales and forests. Tir'Rielle is guarded by the flying creatures, called the Skyguard and the landbound guardians who serve in many capacities. While in Tir'Rielle animals do not suffer illness. They cannot die from old age or the effects thereof. Old horses feel very young and everything is renewed and sustained by magic. The magic also makes food and drink relatively optional (basically, nothing can starve). Pure manavores (creatures that can sustain completely off of magic) no longer have to eat while in Tir'Rielle). Tir'Rielle also offers mundane and magical healings to sick and wounded animals. Note StephanieSmall if you or a character is in need of healing. Breeding Picture that Created this Horse: Starter More Pictures: None Art Creation Notes: I have created this art with a love of animals.

Paul has been taken apart and put back together and I guess we're going to have the final showdown now. So the project is winding down. In all of my illustrations, I've been trying to keep the same kind of themes and styles without doing anything too repetitive, and I've been trying to stay away from a literal interpretation of the writing and add my own perspective to the art. It's been neat to do painting again, and to challenge myself and try and do some themes that I don't often do in my work. One last chapter to go, and we get extra long to work on it.

Also, that info is all true, I've googled it all. Just google it yourselves if you don't believe me. For more info go to these sites, www.nokillnow.com\/PETAIngridNe\u2026 www.nathanwinograd.com Here are some possible FAQs I'll answer. Q: Does PETA really kill animals? A: Yes thanks to the sites Nokillnow and Nathan Winogrand, both of these sites have undeniable proof PETA has killed more animals then they have saved. It was even on the news in 2005 where PETA employees were caught euthanizing animals in the back of a van. Data from these sites also reveal that PETA brought a walk in freezer in 2002, one which they paid over 9,300 dollars for. A walk in freezer would buy something that was maybe 15 by 10 feet. A freezer that size is normally used for storing meat and dairy products which nobody at PETA would be caught with. But a freezer that large would also be used to store dead bodies, which is further proof that they kill animals. Q: What do you mean by militant veganism? I thought being a vegan was healthy? A: PETA's goal is total animal liberation, meaning no more meat, milk, eggs, or honey for consumption. This would also mean no more leather, fur, wool, silk, fishing, service animals, zoos no matter how high the standards, horseback riding, temporary captivity for marine mammals (IE rehabbing whales and dolphins until they can go back to the ocean),aquariums, animals used in medical research, circuses that use animals, even if they are only domesticated, and pets. This can't happen because not everyone can go vegan. I have a friend who like many people is heavily allergic to nuts and peanuts and chances are soy and other beans could get cross contaminated so she needs to eat meat in order to get protein, and certain vitamins and minerals. Also, there are people out there who are also allergic to soy and nuts so going vegan is impossible in order to get the right amount of protein and fat. Also, many people who were former vegans went back to animal based food due to loosing too much weight, not getting enough nutrition, and the fact that it's expensive. Another friend of mine even tried to go vegan twice and she got sick both times. Other data even reveals that without some kind of healthy oil or fat in your diet you won't be able to absorb nutrients from the fruit and vegetables you eat. A good plant based fat comes from sources that are not always in season including coconuts, almonds, avocados, and olive oil. That and due to a lack of animal products a vegan diet is very low in the necessary iron, vitamin B12, and Omega3. Also, even if you were vegan that doesn't mean you can't consume high fructose corn syrup, soy lecithin, other GMO plants, or Indonesian forest destroying palm oil. You see the main problem with obesity is not only because we're eating factory farmed meat, it's also because we're also consuming things with GMO ingredients we can't even say with less than 4 syllables or even be pronounced by a third grader. Q: Do you support animal cruelty? A: No, I just stand for animal welfare, meaning that we use animals for what we normally use but there's no cruelty involved. I eat organic animal products, limit my fast food intake as much as possible, I don't buy real fur *its crazy expensive and gets way too dirty too easily* I refuse to eat anything endangered*Shark fin soup ring a bell?* or foiegras, and I refuse to purchase anything from a pet store that gets there puppies or kittens form mills, I don't go to wild animals circuses, I don't support life long captivity for whales, I hate bullfighting, I avoid food with palm oil in it to help protect the orangutans, and I feel animal testing for cosmetics is backwards. However, I do find leather an exception because the cows used are killed for their meat so every last bit of the animal is used and pleather is made from a non renewable resource, oil. Q:What domestic terrorism? A: The FBI and USDA have classified PETA as terrorist threats in the 2000s, it was in the news. PETA has used people such as Rodney Coronado to blow up medical research labs and even has ties to the ALF, another known domestic terrorist group Ingrid Newkirk herself has even said that she's the last person to condemn the ALF. More recently she sent a letter to James Holmes AKA the Aurora Colorado shooter that he will be less violent if he went vegetarian. They had even compared Oklahoma City bomber Tim McVeigh to Gandhi when he went vegetarian on his last meal. Q: But I thought eating meat was bad for the environment? A: Yes, if it's from factory farms, but a real pasture based organic farm no. What PETA doesn't want you to know is that even if the whole world went vegan the Amazon rainforest had many trees torn down for soy and corn. Soy is found in almost everything and the earth is gaining 80 million more people on average per year, we do have enough food to feed everyone but its given to factory farmed animals or turned into fuel, we could feed the world but it wouldn't be enough if everyone just had corn and soy to eat. Also, in the eyes of big agribusiness, supplies would be limited for so many people unless more tress are cut down, especially since most of this soy and corn is GMO. Over 30% of methane comes form mono cropped arsenic filled rice paddies, pleather is made from oil and synthetic fur is really made from nonrenewable resources and the factories where it's made releases toxic chemicals into the environment. Also, a huge chunk of vegan substitutes contain PALM OIL, usually associated with Indonesian rain forests being cut down or slashed and burned. This causes, human rights abuse for the indigenous people of Sumatra and Borneo, and the endangerment of Indonesian wild life including the orangutans and Sumatran tiger. Let's also not forget that most vegetarian food is often doused in toxic pesticides everyday to control weeds and bugs, and mono cropping with no crop rotation kills top soil and pollutes ground water. Also, one thing that is contributing to honey bees suffering from colony collapse disorder involve pesticides, GMOs and making them pollenate so many fruits and vegetables at once. So most vegan food will not save honey bees. Q: Other than what's listed here what other hypocrisy is there? A: One of their former vice presidents Mary Beth Sweetland who now works for the Humane Society is a type A diabetic that uses insulin tested on animals to stay alive. She feels she doesn't see herself as a hypocrite despite that she campaigned against medical testing on animals. How's that not Hypocritical? Also, Ellen Degeneres *Sp?* supports PETA but she did an ad for Covergirl and oil of Olay, companies that test their products on animals. Pink who did an ad against wool also was a spokes person for Covergirl later on and even openly admitted that she was not informed enough about wool. Joan Rivers supports PETA, but she wears FUR coats. Also, people who participated in the Ink not mink campaign forgot that most black tattoo ink is made from burnt animal bones. For more hypocrites go here. www.petawatch.com Q:If this info is out there then why do they get so much Money? A: Because they use scare tactics in order to trick people into giving them money. They don't go out and say that they are actually going to help animals, they say that they're going to stick the screws to the fur and meat industry and want you to believe what they say. Also, Charity Navigator has even given PETA just one star and reveals that most of the money they make goes towards making expensive advertisements, and protests while only 1% of their money actually goes to helping animals. And you thought that invisible children only donating around 30% of their money to helping children was a bad thing for them to do, these kids get at least about a couple million dollars. Compare that to PETA only donating 1% of their 33 million which is only about 4 to 330,000 dollars. Their main excuse to keep on killing animals is that they don't have the money to support them. Yeah, like 33 million dollars isn't enough money. Also, do you really think I'm lying about sexism? www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m0vQOn\u2026 Also if you want to help animals, please buy organic and\/or pasture raised meat,milk, honey and eggs. Donate to animal welfare groups like WSPA and try to help endangered animals by donating to environmental and wildlife animal protection groups, or take your time to sign petitions to create better welfare for animals and keep up to date with endangered animals. Update* Straight from the horses mouth about their support to the BSL. Their stance on pit bulls is, \"We hope that our support of such laws will stop people from bringing more of these animals into the world to be hurt and exploited.\" This means that they feel all pit bull owners will raise them to be aggressive so they want these dogs to be banned form the planet. Update 2: Apparently Newkirk also feels that PETA is doing the best thing by euthanizing animals, and even claims that a recent article written by Nathan J Winogrand (a no kill advocate) is false and claims PETA to be a shelter of last resort, and not kill healthy animals. What she doesn't know is that this is not what no kill means, no kill means that you only kill the animals if they are suffering and can't be cured, also if they really are a shelter of last resort then how come she doesn't remember the time when perfectly healthy puppies and kittens were killed and put into a dumpster?","medium":null,"title":"Every Dollar Donated to PETA Geekygirl43 Watch Community Projects Awareness 2013 Geekygirl43","url":"https:\/\/geekygirl43.deviantart.com\/art\/Every-Dollar-Donated-to-PETA-319069833\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2013"],"filename":"Every Dollar Donated to PETA Geekygirl43 Watch Community Projects Awareness 2013 Geekygirl43_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/geekygirl43.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/2093\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/217\/f\/c\/every_dollar_donated_to_peta_by_geekygirl43-d59yrux.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Blue"],"artist":"Sasa-Van-Goth","description":"Val Brembana, Italy","medium":null,"title":"Earth Day 2013 Sasa-Van-Goth Watch Community Projects Holidays Recurring Earth Day Sasa-Van-Goth","url":"https:\/\/sasa-van-goth.deviantart.com\/art\/Earth-Day-2013-252244872\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Holidays","Recurring","Earth Day"],"filename":"Earth Day 2013 Sasa-Van-Goth Watch Community Projects Holidays Recurring Earth Day Sasa-Van-Goth_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/sasa-van-goth.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/f039\/i\/2013\/113\/8\/5\/earth_day_2013_by_sasa_van_goth-d466he0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Lunareye","description":"Just another random picture that I found of Dee Dee.

Magnitude of 8.9 on the Richter scale for the Japan's earthquake. Small islands as well as countries such as Philippines, Brazil, were hit by the waves following the tsunami. While Japan being the trendsetter for earthquake prevention and nuclear power technology, however this work is for the people in all the areas who are or will be affected. The idea of developing countries and low elevation areas being hit is pretty scary. I haven't forgotten the South Asian earthquake and tsunamis that occurred several years ago, and while they happened pretty far from where I lived, the horror of seeing people in my neighboring country and the chaos was really saddening. I am glad that the United Nations had said while they will wait for Japan to ask for help, however they will take pro-active initiative when the developing nations and areas are hit for this. Huge blast at Japan nuclear power plant Google Crisis Response Pray, donate whatever you can. Don't fight over the differences on what one should do or not do.

While this scar won't be easy to erase or forget like the previous ones, but we must live on. Like the cycle of cherry blossoms.. Also deviants, stay safe. Earthquakes or otherwise. `snowmask said that while they are safe, her husband, `zerocomplex's hometown was hit, even if some friends contacted that they were okay, even if the aftershocks happened.

I just spent the past three hours blitzing through this one, since I really wanted to do something for Pride 2017 and get it in before 11:59pm, the deadline. Nothing like the last minute, am I right? *crooked grin* I'm definitely going to re-do this one, since my time limit didn't really allow me to make everything look 100% smooth and polished. It definitely needs a lot of tweaking. But it was a good learning experience, as far as being able to hash something halfway decent out in 3 hours or less. A huge challenge for me in my art is just the PAINSTAKING SLOWNESS with which I usually work. I'm super meticulous and like to take time applying all kinds of love and care to my work...which usually means I will be spending several days working on a piece such as this, if I even finish it at all. This was a great exercise in just getting stuff done without worrying too much about the details or the final product. And hey, didn't turn out half bad...though my inner critic\/perfectionist is very, very grumpy... This is Yvonne and Chibi, my characters, two ladies very much in love. I chose the Blue theme for the Pride flag, which represents Harmony and Peace. I thought that fit this picture the best--Yvonne and her lady are almost always on the same page, harmonizing with each other's opposite personality. Yvonne is quiet, reserved, stoic, and calculating--typical Capricorn, really--while Chibi is effusive, bombastic, and playfully charming--typical Leo. The original sketch was in mechanical pencil, and the rest was done in Photoshop. I was going for a kind of retro look for these two. When I revisit it I might alter it to have a more nostalgic, 1960's oversaturated color scheme. Here's the webcomic these two are from.","medium":null,"title":"L'Amour coxamamy Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride coxamamy #blue #gay #lesbian #lgbtq #originalcharacter #retro #romance #webcomic #lesbiancouple #pridemonth2017 #prideflag2017 (show more)","url":"https:\/\/coxamamy.deviantart.com\/art\/L-Amour-685963824\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2017","Pride"],"filename":"L'Amour coxamamy Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride coxamamy #blue #gay #lesbian #lgbtq #originalcharacter #retro #romance #webcomic #lesbiancouple #pridemonth2017 #prideflag2017 (show more)_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/coxamamy.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/7668\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/162\/1\/5\/l_amour_by_coxamamy-dbcel2o.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Yellow"],"artist":"Robsojourn","description":"Rainbow Mermaid Blue - Celebrating Pride and the feeling that sometimes we're not sure where we belong, that we can feel like a fish out of water in our own bodies and that though sometimes the world can be a scary and unforgiving place, there will be moments of joy, belonging and peace.","medium":null,"title":"Rainbow Mermaid Blue Robsojourn Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride Robsojourn","url":"https:\/\/robsojourn.deviantart.com\/art\/Rainbow-Mermaid-Blue-685886122\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2017","Pride"],"filename":"Rainbow Mermaid Blue Robsojourn Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride Robsojourn_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/robsojourn.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/f9ba\/i\/2017\/162\/0\/e\/rainbow_mermaid_blue_by_robsojourn-dbccx4a.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"StormOfShadows1407","description":"this is an edited version of my submission, if i happen to make it onto the flag, i would prefer this to be used","medium":null,"title":"Happy Goat Dragon Bbs StormOfShadows1407 Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride StormOfShadows1407","url":"https:\/\/stormofshadows1407.deviantart.com\/art\/Happy-Goat-Dragon-Bbs-685770064\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2017","Pride"],"filename":"Happy Goat Dragon Bbs StormOfShadows1407 Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride StormOfShadows1407_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/stormofshadows1407.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/5712\/th\/pre\/i\/2017\/161\/d\/a\/happy_goat_dragon_bbs_by_stormofshadows1407-dbcafkg.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"SleepTightStudios","description":"STOP THE HATE","medium":null,"title":"Dem Shrooms Of Acceptance SleepTightStudios Watch Community Projects Awareness 2012 Spirit Day SleepTightStudios","url":"https:\/\/sleeptightstudios.deviantart.com\/art\/Dem-Shrooms-Of-Acceptance-333155808\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2012","Spirit Day"],"filename":"Dem Shrooms Of Acceptance SleepTightStudios Watch Community Projects Awareness 2012 Spirit Day SleepTightStudios_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/sleeptightstudios.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/0d19\/th\/pre\/i\/2012\/293\/d\/9\/dem_shrooms_of_acceptance_by_redmurcury-d5icoo0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"Norski","description":"The two turkeys are back, and safe.

I was bullied as a child and I can still remember some of the incidences almost like they were just yesterday, even after all these years. We are very diverse, but we are all human under the skin.

There is just no excuse at all when you are being the very creature you resent. It's fine to hate the work, but not the people who love it. Just \/think<\/ about your behaviour for a minute.

After 13 years of being my most loyal little sidekick and the loveliest silly cat, she just suddenly died when we were so close to finding what was wrong with her. I have a huge empty hole where my heart was only hours ago. My world just ended and it's name was Lucymia. Here's what happened: after a surgery to remove plaque and unidentified masses, she first seemed to recover just fine. Then suddenly, after a few days, it went downhill. My puffer fish had escaped from its tank and grazed Lucy. She didn't bite or scratch it, but I still worried about external venom, so I contacted puffer fish experts and emergency vet services. They all told me that captive freshwater puffers are not dangerous. So I let it go. But she stopped eating, drinking, washing and sleeping in my bed with me. I took her to the vet who had removed those other things before. She told me that I needed to get rid of the new kitten, Orli-Pompom, because Lucy was just jealous\/stressed\/depressed. But a depressed cat can walk. Lucy couldn't, so I took her to my friend's vet. On the way there, she had gotten much worse. When I took her out of the carrier, she walked in a circle, then collapsed. The vet didn't have the proper equipment and sent me to his colleague who runs a hyper-equipped clinic. That vet then tested Lucy for FIV (feline Aids), did a blood screen etc., and for one, found a pneumonia. He also took x-rays because her kidney had enlarged all of a sudden and her lung wasn't good either. Also her heart was disrupted. Lucy had trouble breathing, so he put her in an oxygen tank. I'm on bad terms with G-d so I asked my orthodox friend to pray for my Mii-Cat and he did. He must have blurted out my name, because the vet came out and told me he may have to resucitate any moment. And he did, he intubated and tried everything, but a moment later, he came back again and only said \"I'm sorry\". I asked him to do a post-mortem exam to find out what took my lovely Mii-Cat from me but I think I knew it was the neurological form of FIP. Update: The autopsy report stated that she died from a congenital heart condition.","medium":null,"title":"Farewell my Mii-Cat AnnaGiladi Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella AnnaGiladi","url":"https:\/\/annagiladi.deviantart.com\/art\/Farewell-my-Mii-Cat-220870000\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Projects","Free Fella"],"filename":"Farewell my Mii-Cat AnnaGiladi Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella AnnaGiladi_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/annagiladi.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/b82b\/i\/2011\/193\/4\/b\/farewell_my_mii_cat_by_ore_sama-d3ni0ds.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"Candys-Killer","description":"MH VALENTINE CARDS!!

Only until he has received his prosthetics does he start his slow journey of recovery or healing. That was my main idea to what the picture is about and the healing process that is displays. All these characters are mine except the man of honor, the red haired male. He belongs to my girlfriend while everyone else belongs to me.

I was so glad to color yet another drawing of my TMNT fanart. You may remember this drawing that I did just before Valentine's Day. Digitally colored entirely with Paint and PhotoShop. Behind this drawing, it's Valentine's Day, and Donatello wants to give a gift for April. A bouquet of roses, which is a modern Valentine's gift. Once Donnie gave her the roses, April set them down, stands on her heels to reach Donnie's lips, he bends his legs to reach her lips, and they are finally kissing. Donnie even wraps his arms around her to balance her. The marks on their cheeks is them blushing. Donnie is beautifully colored, also April, and her bouquet of roses. I thought that April's hair should be detailed like I do with my drawings, I made every strand from her bangs and her short pony tail.

An unknown number of U.S. citizens and legal residents are trafficked within the country primarily for sexual servitude and, to a lesser extent, forced labor. As much as we in America do not want to recognize it, children are now being treated like a commodity on the black market. Sometimes they are simply relocated within their own country. More often they are moved across borders. They are sold for purposes like forced labor, prostitution, pornography, organ removal, or even as child soldiers. They are in high demand as cheap domestic labor, for farm work, and especially for sexual exploitation. Some girls, as young as 13 years of age, are sold as mail-order brides where they are isolated, abused, raped, and subjected to various forms of torture. Unfortunately, child trafficking has become a lucrative business that is directly linked with highly organized criminal activity. It is well hidden underground and very difficult to find and deal with. This makes even the strictest laws against child trafficking hard to enforce.

Let the punishment fall on me. To keep you forever innocent...\" [My dear girl, when will you know, loving somebody, anybody, is not a sin.] . . . It is the illustration of a short story I wrote about 5-6 years ago, which was based on a dream I had got at night. There were two friends, both girls, named Sa and Huyen, Sa was cute and innocent since Huyen was cold and hateful. Sa's lover left her, she fell apart and went to cry to Huyen, Huyen was angry and said let her be Sa's lover instead. They then really did, to Sa it was just a play, pretending game, but Huyen, didn't know when, started to fall in love with Sa and she, of course, was all torn up because of that. Finally, Sa's lover came back and asked her to go with him, Sa accepted and happily told Huyen. Huyen was broken, hardly broken. She let Sa go, telling her nothing. She wished to keep Sa innocent forever. I don't know why I dreamed that, but I felt the hurting soul of Huyen, it did hurt, too much. I think loving somebody is never a sin. I wish Huyen is real to tell her that. . . . Tribute to Spirit Day of DA, a quick sketch with watercolor pencils.

Here it is! Bracken X Soot! I don't mean Braceknfur and Sootwhisker from Warriors, but Bracken is GreenGummies's Oc, and we share Soot. They come from an RP we started while at a school camping trip, my name there was Pine(female), because I saw this pretty pine tree, and GreenGummies picked Bracken (male), so then we created ocs out of them, and started RP with them. They lived together for a long time as best friends on the moor, then one day, Bracken started exploring a mountain nearby, met Soot's father (Ashes) and was scared by him. Later on, Pine and Bracken encounter Soot. Now Pine being that protective and aggressive cat she is, she fought Soot and chased him away. Bracken later on went after him, brought him back, and Ashes soon came along. It turns out Ashes and Soot were part of a Rebellion Group (led by Pine's father, Oak), and were chased away and separated because of the cats they rebelled against. Later on, Bracken and Soot started getting closer, and Pine started accepting the new cats, even though Ashes practically sleeps all day. I used the color blue because it represents the peace and harmony that developed between the cats over time.","medium":null,"title":"LGBTQ+ Pride Devniant Art PlanteraCat Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride PlanteraCat #pridemonth2017","url":"https:\/\/planteracat.deviantart.com\/art\/LGBTQ-Pride-Devniant-Art-685718827\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2017","Pride"],"filename":"LGBTQ+ Pride Devniant Art PlanteraCat Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride PlanteraCat #pridemonth2017_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/planteracat.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/a4b0\/i\/2017\/161\/9\/2\/lgbtq__pride_devniant_art_by_planteracat-dbc9c17.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Yellow"],"artist":"TigRaidoXXX","description":"May the world see us as we are...

I honestly chose orange because the prompt of healing is just something I relate to a lot. I struggle a lot with my own identity in just being genderfluid as people just seem to think that I'm just struggling with some sort of \"Inner Demons\" or something. It just is kinda hard, and I'm still trying to get some control over my depression and anxiety, all because it causes me to not really be able to function correctly with constantly getting stressed\/panicked to the point that I make myself sick. I have so many friends that happen to light up my days and make them better, and if y'all end up reading this I thank you all from the bottom of my heart, even if we don't talk as much anymore, you guys still mean the world to me. I may seem lost with what I'm doing now a days, but I'm slowly picking back up the pieces to getting closer to how I was in the past.

If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. No one wants to die. Even people who wanna go to heaven don't wanna die to get there. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. . Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. Death is the destination we all share, no one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life. I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something Source Photo:[link]","medium":null,"title":"Rest In Peace Steve Jobs amethystmoonsong Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs amethystmoonsong","url":"https:\/\/amethystmoonsong.deviantart.com\/art\/Rest-In-Peace-Steve-Jobs-262203099\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Community Projects","Tributes","Steve Jobs"],"filename":"Rest In Peace Steve Jobs amethystmoonsong Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs amethystmoonsong_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/amethystmoonsong.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/f85c\/th\/pre\/i\/2011\/280\/5\/3\/rest_in_peace_steve_jobs_by_amethystmoonsong-d4c3x7f.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Yellow"],"artist":"NekOTAKUBox","description":"2015 the year where Friday 13th and Valentine's Day spend a week together....but why? >^w^< .

This isn't a subject I'm opening for debate, it's an expression of how I feel -- if you feel differently, go make your own art and rant away. Me, I'm just tired, getting worn down, and need to get this off my chest. I've seen a disappointing trend in Fandom the past couple of years: people bashing other fandoms and\/or belittling others who exhibit something they personally find to be foolish, even when it has nothing to do with them. It's very frustrating to, say, go to a con or a chatroom to celebrate something you love and find the people there bashing something else you love instead, something that's not even on-topic. Or passing judgement with a holier-than-thou attuitude, and half the time they know little beyond the surface of what their talking about. (And in case you're thinking I'm being holier-than-thou myself right now, I will readily admit I have, at times, been guilty of behaving badly towards others now and then -- and it *shames* me.) It's like being back in high school -- it's sad to see so many *adults* act like that. Perhaps I act like a child too, but I'd rather be childish in my interests than in my actions towards others. Name-calling and elitism aren't even what I'd call acceptable on the playground, much less in adult conversation. I'm not suggesting people have to like every fandom \/ clothing style \/ fetish \/ etc. But I have no interest hanging out with people who would apparently rather spend their time treating others with derision rather than celebrating the things they love. You don't like something? Well, unless that something involves harm of some kind, for heaven's sake, would it kill you to live and let live?? Is making others feel miserable about themselves your pasttime? That's called bullying. Bullying isn't just beating people up physically, it's doing something to make their existence one of suffering, which can be done just as easily with words as fists. You think someone looks ridiculous? Fine, we're human. But keep it to yourself -- who made you the fashion police, ne? You think a series someone loves is inane? Fine, you've a right to that opinion, but what makes your interests inherently better than theirs? I'm not saying that one should never say one does or doesn't like something, but there are certainly better ways to go about it than being hateful towards the person whose interest you don't share. I can't tell people how to live and behave, no. So the best I can hope for is to plead that people think twice before they do something that could be cruel. The ones who actively enjoy belittling others? Yeah, there's not much to be done about that -- this message isn't for them. This is for the people who hadn't really considered their actions, and still have a better nature to be appealed to. Remember, before you start to slam something, that your best friend might actually like it -- do you want to hurt them by calling them stupid by proxy? They may have a very personal reason for liking it, experience that you don't have. Don't knock something you haven't tried, and if you have, that still doesn't mean it's cool to be snide and condescending about it. Yes, there are some people that are so rabid about their fandom it's tiresome to be around them. So just avoid them. I'm not saying you have to torture yourself by staying and listening, or even that you can't say you're just not interested and walking away, but even just laughing at someone where they can hear you, much less telling them \"You're a dork\", is malicious. Are you a malicious person? Do you want to be? Remember that there are rabid fans in *every* fandom, so don't assume that *every* person who likes something is that way, no matter how many you meet. Take every person on a case-by-case basis. And when a person *is* rabid about an interest, don't assume, if they have a social problem, that they can control it. Whether you believe Aspergers and\/or autism is real or not, people are what they are; chances are that they would *love* to be more sociable and just can't grasp how to do it. They are not trying to annoy you, but they, whether by genetics, brain wiring, chemical interaction, or how they were raised, behave in a certain fashion by some sort of programming -- we all do. If programming were so easily overcome, would we have addictions and rehab? And why would anyone need to be in rehab more than once? And just like people say to me that they would love to draw but can't, not everyone can read body language well, or control thier enthusiasm. If everyone could do everything, we'd have no specialists. Every thing we do is a skills that some people have and some don't, for whatever the reason. If you don't want people to treat you like crap because you can't do something as easily as they can, then show the same courtesy to others. You are not them, you have never been them, and until science can develop a way to do it, you will never be them. Until you are, you cannot ever say for sure how someone else's brain works, much less why they do or don't like something -- you cannot say, as FACT, whether or not their actions and interests are valid\/have good reasons behind them. So why act as if you have the right to cast judgement and aspersions on them? What right have you to say that they're lying about their experiences? Which of course means I haven't the right to tell you to be nice to people. I'm not. I'm asking you to. Maybe you just are a jerk, and it can't be helped (or you don't want to be). Maybe you even have a good reason for being that way, one I might agree with even if I were in your head and not just seeing the pain you cause. But I have seen some bullies change, and it's to those with the potential to do so that I appeal. After all, bullying might build character in some, but in other cases, it can make even people who who might have otherwise been outgoing and loving closet themselves -- or, worse, \"go Columbine\", ne? And really, this is a reminder to myself as well; I want to bring joy to people, not pain. So please: ~remember that any moment you are not alone, you are particpating in Community. Do you want to live in a hateful, hurtful Community, or a nurturing one? Sure, there's probably always going to be hate in the world, but I believe we shape our world with our attitudes, and so if more people had a positive attitude, the world could be a better place. ~ be courteous. If you want to be allowed to live as you see fit (within reason) in peace, extend that same courtesy to others. Live by the Golden Rule. Maybe some people see you as being just as rabid about one of your interests. Which is nicer?: \"Oh god, I hate that show, it's so stupid! People who like it are morons!\" Or \"Eh, it's not for me.\" How would you like people to treat your fandom? ~ be kind and compassionate. It costs you nothing to smile or be helpful, and you may one day find yourself in a situation where you need kindness. You're more likely to get it if we encourage everyone to be that way. ~ be civil. You can say you dislike something or disagree with a notion and still be friendly while doing it. You're not supporting your point of view if your argument includes name-calling and the phrase \"shut up\". When discussing a show, for example, remember that the debate is about the point in question, not the people you're debating with. ~ stop accepting that sort of behavior. You can't actually tell someone to stop being a meanie, but you can say you don't like that behavior, don't want any part of it, and even that you won't allow it in your presence -- defend those who need it. So this image is mean to be a reminder of those points. It was inspired by Sailor Moon, her transformational magic, and the empowering lyrics of a song from it, \"The Power of Love\",: \"Blazing emotion There's a light that flows from the heart It's a chain-reaction and nothing will keep us apart Stand by my side There's nothing to hide Together, we'll fight to the end Take hold of my hand And you'll understand what it truly measns to be friends You've got to believe in the power of love You've got to believe in the power of love It gives meaning to each moment It's what our hearts are all made of You've got to believe in the power of love ...\" song lyrics © Jennifer Chihi\/Kid Rhino Some anti-bullying organisations: [link] [link] And, because I do have to make a living when I can with my original work , if you do happen to like this image and want a copy, it's available as a print here (see link under image) and on Cafepress swag: [link]","medium":null,"title":"Share the Love WolfenM Watch Community Projects Awareness 2010 Spirit Day WolfenM","url":"https:\/\/wolfenm.deviantart.com\/art\/Share-the-Love-139524469\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2010","Spirit Day"],"filename":"Share the Love WolfenM Watch Community Projects Awareness 2010 Spirit Day WolfenM_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/wolfenm.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/723b\/i\/2009\/280\/6\/1\/share_the_love_by_wolfenmoondaughter.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":["null","null"],"artist":"Peach-X-Yoshi","description":"well! here it is! our collab! ^^ i would like to thank EVERYBODY for taking part! all of you did great! ^^ and i know some people couldn't do it, but thats ok! ^^ because we could organize something different next year! ^^ anyways, starting from the top left corner going across we have: ~Daisyfan2 *pink-delights ~MarioKirby64 ~yoshiwoopwoop ~twilightfan4567 =luigifan607 *SapphireSparkle *marioblade64 *Blazikenpwnsyou ~kirby-kaabii *Peach-X-Yoshi <--(me...XD) ~snowsuper123 =ChibiAisuu ~silver7blaze ~lillilotus ~yoshiberry1998 ~Gamegirlkaylz *Juliana1121 ~SoccerMango ~KiKiD484 *LuigiStar445 and ~Yoshi66666666 thanks so much for doing this guys! and i do hope you had fun! ^^ i shure did!","medium":null,"title":"collab-Christmas 2010 :D Peach-X-Yoshi Watch Community Projects Holidays 2010 Christmas Peach-X-Yoshi","url":"https:\/\/peach-x-yoshi.deviantart.com\/art\/collab-Christmas-2010-D-190913898\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Holidays","2010","Christmas"],"filename":"collab-Christmas 2010 :D Peach-X-Yoshi Watch Community Projects Holidays 2010 Christmas Peach-X-Yoshi_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/peach-x-yoshi.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/4904\/i\/2010\/359\/6\/9\/collab_christmas_2010__d_by_peach_x_yoshi-d35ny3u.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"MariaAnhelo","description":"I want to assure you, I ve always seen Michael as a normal man who loves women.

Took several hours and I used photoshop for the most part, FireAlpaca for the line art!! Although it's the 29th today, at least where I live, I decided to post it earlier. With Halloween fast approaching and me being busy and well behind on several school assignments, I'm also in charge of making my sister's Halloween costume. Luckily making No Face from Spirited away is very fun, but making his from scratch is a total bummer. >.< Ah anyway, this a completely random OC whom I probably will never draw every again. I'm quickly realizing my work always looks better with lots of time. Photoshop too is quite a challenge, especially with the intimidating look. -_- Ha! I miss Paint Tool Sai, but It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for my Mac Well, I hope all of you have a fantastic Halloween, and if you're the lucky few who can still trick-or-treat, Trick-or-treat safely!!!

However she came to our house one day when I saw her and called her to eat some croquettes. Gyny was scared of us at first and I had to stay away from the food so she could get closer to the bowl. With the time, she started to get into the house slowly: At first she wasn't going any further than the kitchen, with the time she went exploring more rooms of the house and she suddenly started to stay inside for a whole day. We took her to the veterinary one day I noticed she cried every time someone touched her stomach. There we got to know about her situation and we gave her a home, food and a medical treatment for her. She was operated and the stoned kitty was succesfully removed from her. After this I adopted her officially and my mother gave her the name she has. Now she's a happy house cat that behaves like a human and sleeps in my bed most of the time; I'm thankfull to her because she makes me company even when I'm sick and purrs for me when I'm sad, sick or stressed. Even if she's not my first cat, I love her with all my heart and I've come into her defense when someone bothers her.","medium":null,"title":"My only Queen sovkhozy Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella sovkhozy","url":"https:\/\/sovkhozy.deviantart.com\/art\/My-only-Queen-293534149\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Projects","Free Fella"],"filename":"My only Queen sovkhozy Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella sovkhozy_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/sovkhozy.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/ff06\/i\/2012\/092\/4\/b\/my_only_queen_by_azuka_mikoi-d4urged.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Yellow"," Yellow"],"artist":"thephotogenesis","description":"Another Adorkable version of my little dork!","medium":null,"title":"Upside down thephotogenesis Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella thephotogenesis","url":"https:\/\/thephotogenesis.deviantart.com\/art\/Upside-down-293611934\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Projects","Free Fella"],"filename":"Upside down thephotogenesis Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella thephotogenesis_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/thephotogenesis.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/ea91\/i\/2012\/092\/1\/a\/upside_down_by_lithp-d4ut4f2.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Green"],"artist":"AK49BWL","description":"Now how could I possibly resist uploading a picture when dA does something like this?

How Victims Are Trafficked Many victims of trafficking are exploited for purposes of commercial sex, including prostitution, stripping, pornography and live-sex shows. However, trafficking also takes place as labor exploitation, such as domestic servitude, sweatshop factories, or migrant agricultural work. Traffickers use force, fraud and coercion to compel women, men and children to engage in these activities. Force involves the use of rape, beatings and confinement to control victims. Forceful violence is used especially during the early stages of victimization, known as the \u0091seasoning process\u0092, which is used to break victim\u0092s resistance to make them easier to control. Fraud often involves false offers that induce people into trafficking situations. For example, women and children will reply to advertisements promising jobs as waitresses, maids and dancers in other countries and are then trafficked for purposes of prostitution once they arrive at their destinations. Coercion involves threats of serious harm to, or physical restraint of, any person; any scheme, plan or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; or the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process.","medium":null,"title":"Human Trafficking shadowlight-oak Watch Community Projects Awareness 2010 Human Trafficking Awareness shadowlight-oak","url":"https:\/\/shadowlight-oak.deviantart.com\/art\/Human-Trafficking-186843769\/?purchase=print&itemids=88","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2010","Human Trafficking Awareness"],"filename":"Human Trafficking shadowlight-oak Watch Community Projects Awareness 2010 Human Trafficking Awareness shadowlight-oak_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/shadowlight-oak.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/7878\/th\/pre\/i\/2010\/324\/d\/1\/human_trafficking_by_shadowlight_oak-d338pkp.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"NyanSonia","description":"I really love Valentines day, because this holiday is full of love and couple.

She is young, not a year, at most 6-8 months. When I adopted her, she was named Lucky. But I had a cat named Luna just two years ago, so I've caught myself trying to say the wrong name. I haven't found a name yet thats better than Lucky, so far I haven't changed it. I'm looking though a baby name book for names that fit for fortunate, lucky, life, or snow. Its possible that I may combine names to make one I like. The story I was told is that she was a rescue kitten, found at the begining of winter (Wisconsin winter=snow) weighing under a pound. The rescuers thought she may be 2-3 yrs, but the vet said if she was that small, then she was younger. They nursed her back to health and got her to gain weight, she's nearly 6lbs in this pic. I went in to Animart since I knew they adopt out rescue pets, not kennel-bred puppies\/kittens. I saw her and fell in love, she was small and quiet. She looked similar to a TurkishAngora, not a shorthair, but not extremely longhair. I owned one cat, Alacer, that weighed 25 pounds, and left bruises on my arms! And no, it wasn't all fat,he was the size of some dogs! So her size caught my eye. I couldn't get Lucky that day since I had to get documentation that my apts allowed pets. She ws so cute, I thought that someone would snacth her up quick. I went back a week later and she was still there. So I visited with her to attempt to see her personality. Four days and an operation (she need was spayed) later, I brought her home. EDIT = I chose 'Tyche' as her name. I cheated and used a name for a Goddess of luck from some Forgotten Realms books. Tyche was original goddess of luck (good and bad) that split into Tamora(good luck) and Beshaba (bad)","medium":null,"title":"Hello World Katzztar Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella Katzztar","url":"https:\/\/katzztar.deviantart.com\/art\/Hello-World-164333593\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Projects","Free Fella"],"filename":"Hello World Katzztar Watch Community Projects Projects Free Fella Katzztar_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/katzztar.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/b198\/i\/2010\/136\/4\/d\/hello_world_by_katzztar.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"gilderic","description":"A man and a woman coming back to their hotel.

Even Satanism teaches the positivity of focusing on yourself and being less open to hurtful thoughts and actions of others and yourself. For a bad deity, such as Satan, Satanism seems to be a positive religion. I don't know what religion any of you guys are out there, and I don't care. Religion is not there to force onto others. It's your own personal belief. I'm a Pagan, I don't care what you guys think about that. So why should it matter who marries who? North Carolina is Passing a law to have the state religion be Christianity. This kinda ties into my anger aswell. Not everyone believes in Jesus being their Lord and Savior. Not only is that disrespectful, but it's forcing a religion down peoples throats. Seriously America? We abandoned Europe because of religious persecution...

There are varying levels in the autism spectrum. Some people are non-verbal, others are high functioning. These days, so many children are getting diagnosed with autism and ADHD that it's starting to draw a lot of attention(good, bad or otherwise) Growing up with a brother who has cerebral palsy and Autism, I had more exposure to people with a disabilities. For a long time, I would wonder why people looked at my brother weird. I'll admit, I've done the same to someone with Down Syndrome. Because of this, I feel like \"normal\" people should take an initiative to learn a little more about disabilities, because at SOME point in their life, they will meet one. tl;dr Autism is like a puzzle, It's extremely overwhelming at first, until you actually pay attention and start putting pieces together and learn about a person. I'm not saying you should be best buddies, but at least polite and civil in public. if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. Keep your thoughts to yourself.

This was the first time I drew two guys together in an intimate way and I love how it turned out! Character Info: Their names are Aubry(on the left) and Adrien(on the right). They do freelance work as models. They are lovers; they met each when they were both working for the same designer in a fashion show; it was love at first sight. Aubry is down to earth and level headed, while Adrien is more carefree and dreamy, his head is always in the clouds. Aubry at times has to bring Adrien back down to earth, he tends to space out a lot! (I referenced the pose that this two are in from a Tripp NYC poster I had printed out a long time ago. I would post the link to the actual poster, but the picture isn't on their website anymore.

A day where our society forces you to buy stuff for your special one and the day where singles get the idea shoved in the face that they are alone and must find somebody so they can buy stuff as well. Wonderful, isn't it? But taking that aside, this drawing was just made for fun. I'm very sadistic, I know. But while this drawing was just for fun, I felt something when it was almost finished. A not so happy feeling. I feel alone. Of course, I've got great pals both online and real life, amazing parents, idols, money and whatnot. I'm just missing that special one. Not just because of Valentine's Day, just in general. Ah well, I'm only 17, So it's normal I guess, nothing to fret about So anyway, I hope you like this drawing, it's one of my most cruel ones yet.

( I actually do not have a red pair of heels these heels are actually blue. As you can tell I photoshoped them to red for this piece. ) Why do we walk? Why do we care? Why do we bother? Because every year 53,600 people are infected with HIV and this is only in the USA. With that statistic alone people should be concerned and want to help their fellow man. HIV does not affect those of just color or sexual orientation, it affects anyone. HIV does not discriminate against gender, race, religion, or does it care about the amount of money you make. I feel that in my country alone, as I can not speak for other countries or other parts of the world. We have turned our heads to HIV\/AIDS awareness. I have learned from other teenagers that are now adults, like me, that their sex education class they never even learned about HIV or even learned of any other STD's for that matter. It is sad day to hear from people that their education about such topics as this have been very limited. We need to redo this. Knowledge is power and with knowledge I believe we can personally fight back against HIV and other STD's for that matter. With our heads turns I guess we just assume that this problem will go away. As more and more people become infected and more and more people die from this disease we just pretend that it will all go away. What? Would you let your dog crap on the floor and than just leave it there in hopes that it will just \"go away\"? No you clean that shit up! We need to clean HIV\/AIDS up. We need to stand up and be heard. The beginning of my college I did this report over HIV\/AIDS awareness and I found this beautiful woman, Mary Fisher. She did this breathe taking speech at a Republican Convention about AIDS awareness. She was amazing! [link] Watch it please! Anyways, it seems that in the ninties there was a big uproar about it and everyone was focused on it for a few years. But now we have turned our heads away from it. Honestly at times I will find myself forgetting about it. Not because I am a dick but just because there is not much out there about it. I hear more about breast cancer awareness than I do HIV. Which I guess is understandable since cancer is a bigger killer but none the less HIV is still a killer that needs to be stopped. Now I am just rambling. So this year I really hope to go to an AIDS walk.

Instead, I have used a link from a snow stage theme from a video game. I think it will have to do. www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ob9J1S\u2026 This is for the Holiday Card Project, but every deviant can obviously see it from their screen. I have managed to upload this deviation, before I completely lost it in my stack of drawings... Oh well, this deviation introduces a new addition to the Little Siders. I haven't picked a name for her yet, but the name \"Noche\" comes to mind. I dunno, I thought of having her back story coming around the regions of Meho and other Hispanic nations. Indigenous myths travel orally about some \"woman\" lurking around the rural regions searching for crimers and troublemakers. Her sentence depends on separating flesh and soul, or integrating into the nightmare realm. Her mentions are primarily used by parents to frighten their misbehaving children to prevent them from leaving curfew. Many can point out this Sider may be based on the Weeping Woman, or La Llorona, and there may be a correlation between these two. I will note that the Sider's colors are just proto-colors; the colors are not her main attire. I may make her gray, or some other whimsical color that not many people know about. The color family is stupendous when you take the time to recall colors and the subcategories. Anyways, this Sider will be apart of the Good Siders and will be a main member in the second version. She seems to be the Sider who speaks with old traditional sentences. A caring Sider who watches over the hapless, she is possibly the first Sider (since she was anti-social) to watch over the Humans, but only in a regional margin. Anyways, I hope many won't get a lonely feeling around December. The title pretty much sums up what this Sider speaks about. She will watch over you and remain by your side in your time of need. You are not alone, you were never alone.

A time when mankind accepts each other as we are, brothers and sisters no matter how near or far. We are all the same deep down inside, we all want peace before we die. The place is here and the time is now, we can't just give up and throw in the towel. Peace is possible but will require a good deal of work, from all of us getting our hands down in the dirt. Every step we take today gets us one step closer to peace tomorrow, remember that one day our small steps will help end our worlds sorrow.

There comes a time, when we hear a certain call When the world must come together as one There are people dying, and it's time to lend a hand. To life the greatest gift of all We can't go on, pretending day by day That someone somewhere will soon make a change We are all part of God's great big family And the truth, you know that love is all we need We are the world, we are the children We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving There's a choice we're making We're saving our own lives It's true, we'll make a better day just you and me. Send them your heart, so they'll know that someone cares And their lives will be stronger and free As God has shown us, by turning stones to bread. So that we all must lend a helping hand.

It was a really great experience. This is the second time we have participated and got to meet more of the local group of people and family members with leiomyosarcoma. The walk is a fundraiser to support all Sarcoma through the NW Sarcoma Foundation. This photo is Team LMS. There were many other teams and must have bee more than 200 participants in all. I am posting this here to allow a place where team members can order a team photo, if they desire. All proceeds will go right back into LMS research, of course. The print photo will not be watermarked. I am also giving permission for team members to capture this one image for their own use, but do suggest that it not be printed as it is a very low resolution image and would print very poorly. More of the images that I took around Greenlake on Saturday will be posted here later on. I ask that copyrights be respected for those images. They will also be made available for print orders with proceeds, like the proceeds of every print that I sell, going to the fund for LMS. If you like them, please order them from the print shop or contact me directly if you have special requests.","medium":null,"title":"Dragon Slayers 2009 e-CJ Watch Community Projects Tributes Other e-CJ","url":"https:\/\/e-cj.deviantart.com\/art\/Dragon-Slayers-2009-120630999\/?purchase=print&itemids=20","tags":["Community Projects","Tributes","Other"],"filename":"Dragon Slayers 2009 e-CJ Watch Community Projects Tributes Other e-CJ_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$35.51","artistURL":"https:\/\/e-cj.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/851a\/f\/2009\/116\/5\/0\/5066b40946ae3bec4bca8238cb5a4cb8.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Blue"],"artist":"andnowwhat","description":"Esta es mi contribución al Día Hispano en Deviantart!!!!

I'm in no way an \"Apple person\" (the last time I remember using an Apple in any significant way was playing Wake The Mac with a crappy old B&W Macintosh and a duct tape ball - but that's another story).. Everything I do these days is done with my trusty HP TM2 with PS on Win7, which is perfect in nearly every way (WTF is with your pen nubs though HP?? is the fact they scratch the screen some sleazy technique to force us to buy new computers ala Ford's internal fuel tank seals, or do you just have a brown eared wood newt doing your stylus design??) Ahem.. I digress. So anyway, though I'm hardly a suitable tribute artist for Mr. Jobs, this idea popped into my head and I figured I'd doodle up a basic version and send it here.. Since I know there's MANY tempestuous artist ty.. err people who are very passionate about their Apples, feel free to grab this image and do it up however you like, consider it public domain (especially since it's not like I could copyright the MacOS logo nor Jobs' image anyway). Let me know if you want the PSD for it (wish there was a way I could upload it along with the image so you could just grab it whenever you wanted - if you know how to do it feel free to kindly let me know) so you can spread the pomaceous love, man. P.S. I do think Steve was a visionary (if a bit of an egomaniac - wtf with the license plate \"game\") and he certainly had good taste in women, I always thought Joan Baez resembled my ex-fiancee who was way too good for me, finally realized it and left my sorry butt =\/ P.P.S. In a turn of events even more ironic than a total lifelong non-Apple user painting up a tribute to Steve, if you want the absolute PERFECT theme song for his life (since I know a bunch of you far more talented people than myself are cooking up videos and such), use \"It's My Life\" by Bon Jovi. If you're a REAL Apple believer, I'm sure you already know why that's incredibly ironic but if not look it up, it's funny how things turn out! P.P.P.S. I turned the print thingie on so people could run this off if they liked it, but if you want a suitable high-res version for printing yourself just let me know.. Or if you're rich and feel bad for me because I'm poor, feel free to use the print function here - I highly recommend it much as I do anything that tosses me a kickback! P.P.P.P.S. Gah somehow lost the dimplish thing, uploaded a version with it.. It's also a larger version so you can just grab that if you need a higher resolution.","medium":null,"title":"Steve Jobs - iTsMyLife rembrandt-1976 Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs rembrandt-1976","url":"https:\/\/rembrandt-1976.deviantart.com\/art\/Steve-Jobs-iTsMyLife-262354981\/?purchase=print&itemids=83","tags":["Community Projects","Tributes","Steve Jobs"],"filename":"Steve Jobs - iTsMyLife rembrandt-1976 Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs rembrandt-1976_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/rembrandt-1976.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/17a7\/th\/pre\/i\/2011\/281\/f\/1\/steve_jobs___itsmylife_by_rembrandt_1976-d4c76ed.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," White"],"artist":"hugomaster5","description":"Rip Steve.

My principal Mrs. Cook has been battling breast cancer for the past few months. Every aspect of this is important, and carries a lot of meaning: A Coat of Arms is more than a pretty picture of a shield and some ribbons. It also sports an amazing amount of symbolism. Each portion represents something more than what is on the surface, so naturally I wanted to put a few things in for Mrs. Cook. The top left portion of the shield depicts a sunset over the ocean. Mrs. Cook mentioned she liked the ocean. If you look closely, the rays coming off the sun take on the shape of a cross. This represents her faith. Now look at the top right portion. Mrs. Cook said that if she could be any animal, she would choose to be a dolphin. This reply threw me off a bit. I had expected something like a dog, cat, bird, or maybe even a tiger. This was a surprise. The school librarian and I did some digging, and found out a few things about the symbolism behind the dolphin. As it turns out, the dolphin symbolizes harmony, freedom, communication, and trust. Beyond that it also stands for wisdom and a sense of community spirit. Good choice Mrs. Cook! The bottom left field boasts a picture of a tree. This tree represents Mrs. Cook\u2019s Strength. Notice the roots. Every tree relies on its roots for support. Mrs. Cook often mentioned in our interview that she remembered her upbringing, and that every choice we make builds off another. The roots symbolize her experiences and choices. The bottom right is a little strange, and might need a little explaining. In our interview, Mrs. Cook mentioned that she once wrote for her school paper. Her teacher would wear pig slippers\u2026 so there you have it: Piggy\u2026 Slippers\u2026 \u2018nuff said. Take a look around the shield. Colors and items also hold meaning in heraldry. The sword represents her strength, whereas its cross shape represents her faith, the source of that strength. Now, we all know that our school colors are maroon and white, and I originally planned to include the colors in order to show school pride. As it turns out, the colors meant something deeper in heraldry. The maroon in the picture represents fortitude and victory. The white signifies truth, sincerity, peace, innocence, and purity. And of course, the pink ribbon. As we all know, Mrs. Cook is battling breast cancer.

Two weeks ago, me my sister, and my boyfriend decided to go to Herz'liah city harbor, Israel. (After visiting Ariel city) We were walking on the promenade after we ate in a restaurant, and there was a fair with all kinds of stands. This was one of the stands that caught my and my sisters eye. It was a glass artist. My sister like necklaces with glass decorations, and I like things that are generally shiny. And then I saw theses necklaces that guy made and set for selling for any wishing heart, and I thought to myself, \"I have never taken a picture of the peace symbol before, while I speak of it's importance to the people in DA. That could be actually something nice and interesting to show.\" So here it is, long before I even knew of that project running in DA. A peace message brought to you from Israel, and it's people. As long as you treat us with respect and don't restrict our freedom of: life, religion, homeland, security and culture, there is no need for us to protect ourselves against you (to use any force or weaponry). But when people try to: take control, illegitimate our government and state, attack us in terror attacks that kill, injure and brake families and their lives, do war provocations, illegal border crossing on land, sea and sky - then we have to protect our lives. Because we know how dear they are. We care for our children, families and friends. We are civilized people, who wish nothing more than to live our life in peace, have education, job, home and family. We always wished nothing but peace, unfortunately we had to fight for our rights to live and survive, as Jews, as Israelis, as Zionists - whatever you call us. Zionism - some might think it's a murderous agenda, while it's not. It's nothing more than loving your land and people, wanting to build a home and a settlement, live in there, have kids, so they will also have their kids there and so on. I think we had enough fights. We proved that we deserve to live, we don't ask for anything special, just what any normal person would ask for. Those who are in peace with us, can easily come and tour in Israel. Believe in whatever religion they want (as long as it is not radically violent), and enjoy our views, archeological, historical and holy sites, services, good production and the magic of our land. If you come in peace, this is what you shall have. Please, don't come to us with war and hate upon your hearts, as the majority of our people had done nothing to justify such disastrous attitude. I wish it will be Peace and Love for us all, so we could prosper and live happy lives full of happiness and joy. Amen. (C) To myself for the work.

Did you know the origin of Valentine's Day? As every christian holiday, it takes its origin from a pagan festival. In this case from the \"Lupercalia\": an ancient Roman festival (the latin word is actually plural, it took more than one day). It was a festival about fertility, it hasn't anything to do with the concept of romantic love that western culture created artificially during the Middle Ages mostly through Italian and ancient French literature. It's not clear, though, when precisely Valentine's Day started to be the festival we know, about romantic love and stuff, but probably it was about like that even during XV century.

To try to get the princess's attention and prove his love, he brought her exquisite and amazing gifts from far and wide. One day he came across two magical pink bunnies and offered them both to the princess. At this point, the story teller pulls off the two outer pink petals and sets each on it sides to show the animals. The princess was unmoved by the rabbits so, he tried again and presented her with beautiful dangly earrings. The next two inner white petals are separated and held up next to the narrator's ears for display. Still, the princess paid him no attention. The prince was so distraught over being spurned that he took a dagger and stabbed himself. The remaining centre of the flower is shaped like an outline of a heart with a line down the centre. The heart is held up, the dagger-like line is removed, and the story teller plunges the \"knife\" through the heart's centre. The princess, realizing too late that she did love the prince, cried out, \"My heart shall bleed for my prince forever more!\" and her heart bleeds to this day.","medium":null,"title":"Bleeding heart Moonbeam13 Watch Community Projects Charitable Events 2008 Artisan Crafts Silent Auction Moonbeam13","url":"https:\/\/moonbeam13.deviantart.com\/art\/Bleeding-heart-18436389\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Charitable Events","2008","Artisan Crafts Silent Auction"],"filename":"Bleeding heart Moonbeam13 Watch Community Projects Charitable Events 2008 Artisan Crafts Silent Auction Moonbeam13_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/moonbeam13.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/0eea\/i\/2009\/183\/8\/6\/bleeding_heart_by_moonbeam13.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," White"],"artist":"holaso","description":"Based of the Chapter 4 literature [link] by ~CZGrey for the Clive Barker Odyssey II Collaborative Project It features Paul as he is opening his aquatic eyes and sprouts tentacles from the sacks growing on his back.","medium":null,"title":"I Am Not A Normal Spawn holaso Watch Community Projects Projects Odyssey Project Clive Barker Chapter 4 Artwork holaso","url":"https:\/\/holaso.deviantart.com\/art\/I-Am-Not-A-Normal-Spawn-338009003\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Community Projects","Projects","Odyssey Project","Clive Barker","Chapter 4","Artwork"],"filename":"I Am Not A Normal Spawn holaso Watch Community Projects Projects Odyssey Project Clive Barker Chapter 4 Artwork holaso_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/holaso.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/780d\/i\/2012\/321\/3\/2\/i_am_not_a_normal_spawn_by_holaso-d5l8pez.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," Black"],"artist":"zepaulo","description":"Personal Work: Steve Jobs Tribute","medium":null,"title":"Goodbye Steve zepaulo Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs zepaulo","url":"https:\/\/zepaulo.deviantart.com\/art\/Goodbye-Steve-261994100\/?purchase=print&itemids=85","tags":["Community Projects","Tributes","Steve Jobs"],"filename":"Goodbye Steve zepaulo Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs zepaulo_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$7.67","artistURL":"https:\/\/zepaulo.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/b512\/f\/2011\/279\/6\/c\/goodbye_steve_by_zepaulo-d4bzfxw.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," White"],"artist":"MinerDoesArt","description":"Let me just say I HATE THIS MEME!! but I only made this for the Valentines thing.

I wasn't at school on 10\/20\/10 to show off my purple but I wore it all day, sick, at home OuO EDIT: A few people asked so I'll post it here Pansexuality (also referred to as omnisexuality) is a sexual orientation, characterized by the potential for aesthetic attraction, romantic love, or sexual desire towards people, regardless of their gender identity or biological sex. Some pansexuals suggest that they are gender-blind; that gender and sex are insignificant or irrelevant in determining whether they will be sexually attracted to others. For others, an individual\u0092s sex, gender expression, or gender identity can be a key factor of attraction, despite the pansexual individual\u0092s wide range of sex and gender attractions. As cited from the Oxford English Dictionary is as \"That encompasses all kinds of sexuality; not limited or inhibited in sexual choice with regards to gender or practice.\" EDIT EDIT: KCVKMVMKV ;A; Thank you guys SO FREAKING MUCH for over 1,000 views and almost 250 faves ;A;<33333333 Someone even requested this a a print too -dies- so that's available now ;U; Never done prints before; lemme know if you have a problem with the process oAo;; (Though I probably won't know how to help '''OTL) With all the llamas I've been giving out, I 'tripped' the server and have to wait a few minutes before I can give moar llamas x'DD","medium":null,"title":"Spirit Day Yaichiko Watch Community Projects Awareness 2010 Spirit Day Yaichiko","url":"https:\/\/yaichiko.deviantart.com\/art\/Spirit-Day-183392683\/?purchase=print&itemids=19","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2010","Spirit Day"],"filename":"Spirit Day Yaichiko Watch Community Projects Awareness 2010 Spirit Day Yaichiko_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$4.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/yaichiko.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/988a\/f\/2010\/294\/d\/d\/spirit_day_by_yaichiko-d316qp7.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Red"],"artist":"FOERVRAENGD","description":"Reference used: [link] A painting of the best cat on the internet: Maru!

This is for 's Contest 16 - The Artists The underlying idea of the contest is to draw the people behind Disney films who have most inspired you. Who are your chosen artists? I chose Ed Catmull, Steve Jobs, and John Lasseter When were they born? And when did they work for Disney? Ed was born on March 31, 1945 in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Steve was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California. John was born on January 12, 1957 in Hollywood, California. These men are remembered as the driving force behind Pixar Animation Studios. Pixar began in 1979 under Lucasfilm; it was bought by Steve Jobs in 1986; it has now been owned by The Walt Disney Company since 2006. What did they do? 1. Started Pixar. 2. Made my favorite movies. 3. Inspire people around the world. In 2007 Brad Bird said it best: \"All three Pixar founders are smart people who understand the creative process better than anyone. To have one of those guys would be amazing; to have three of them in the same company is a freak of nature. It should be respected in the same way as the Grand Canyon: it happened, nobody knows how it happened, but you've got to be humbled by it.\" What do you find inspiring about these artists? Their drive to give the world the best they can give. What can every aspiring artist learn from these remarkable men? Perseverance. All of these men have gone through many difficult trials, but they did not give up.

I nostri occhi scrutavano famelici i tratti dei nostri visi, analizzavano attenti le curve del naso, delle orecchie, della bocca, la forma della fronte. Poi, un sorriso. Ecco cosa mi piaceva di lei. Era uno di quei sorrisi che ti fanno dimenticare dove ti trovi, che oscurano qualsiasi cosa ti circondi e diventano l\u2019unica melodia in una stanza invasa dalla musica. Con lei non c\u2019era bisogno di parlare. I suoi occhi color ambra esprimevano più di semplici parole. Ci venimmo in contro, come al rallentatore: al centro della piazza, fermi, immobili, continuammo a guardarci. Il battito regolare del mio cuore faceva da sottofondo ai nostri sguardi silenziosi e carichi di affetto. Le sfiorai una guancia e lei appoggiò la sua mano sulla mia. E mi sorrise. Di nuovo. Mi sporsi in avanti e le nostre labbra si trovarono subito, dolci, soffici, leggere come le ali di un angelo.

I have a reason to be genderfluid, unlike those 13-17 year olds. I thought I was a boy when I was I think 4 or 5. I felt I wasn't like the other girls and yet I had some things in my life such as both girl and boy toys. Going through high school I felt right with the guys in PE though I went to separate locker rooms like normal people do and I was the only girl in weight lifting side in which most of the guys were going for. Way after high school and going through as a 22 yo at the time, I found out that genderfluid is a thing even though it wasn't the right place (Tumblr) but yes I accepted and came out to my soon to be husband Larry about it, he felt weird at first but he accepted the feelings I had. I'm happy I have a woman's body but there are times I wonder what it's like being a guy having a penis for one day. There will be times I feel like a guy wearing men's clothes and there will be times I feel neutral and there's feminine times I feel while I rarely wear dresses. Guys thank you for reading my part of this and I wish you all a great pride month! NOTE: Anyone who tries to force me to believe in your theory really needs to back the fuck off, If you do keep on harping stupid shit opinions on me thinking you are god and try to force me to agree all the way you are AUTOMATICALLY BLOCKED I try to be nice to people even on here but if they don't respect my opinion by the words AGREE TO DISAGREE you're being abusive and never worth my time I don't give a fuck if you believe in two or +70 genders just don't force me to believe your shit all the way. I at least try to be respectful and talk bullshit while AGREE TO DISAGREE but that don't give anyone the right to be abusive towards one another for just a fucking opinion or whatever! FOR FUCKS SAKE YOU ALL NEED TO GROW UP OR GET OFF THE INTERNET FOR DAMN ONCE like a real adult who needs a job (or creating one) and also go fucking socialize outside the net like a real human being!!! If it says it's all a bullshit lie within +10 years I'm more likely to believe as a person\/human not a sheep.","medium":null,"title":"Genderfluid Pride Manda-Tee Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride Manda-Tee #gender #genderfluidpride #genderfluid #lgtbq #pridemonth #lgtbqia","url":"https:\/\/manda-tee.deviantart.com\/art\/Genderfluid-Pride-683827173\/?purchase=print&itemids=83","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2017","Pride"],"filename":"Genderfluid Pride Manda-Tee Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride Manda-Tee #gender #genderfluidpride #genderfluid #lgtbq #pridemonth #lgtbqia_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$5.75","artistURL":"https:\/\/manda-tee.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/d141\/th\/pre\/f\/2017\/151\/3\/b\/genderfluid_pride_by_manda_tee-dbb4sf9.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Red"," Black"],"artist":"Devilicious-Pink","description":"Steve Jobs digital painting Made on Photoshop CS5","medium":null,"title":"Steve Jobs Painting Devilicious-Pink Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs Devilicious-Pink","url":"https:\/\/devilicious-pink.deviantart.com\/art\/Steve-Jobs-Painting-262101162\/?purchase=print&itemids=85","tags":["Community Projects","Tributes","Steve Jobs"],"filename":"Steve Jobs Painting Devilicious-Pink Watch Community Projects Tributes Steve Jobs Devilicious-Pink_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$7.67","artistURL":"https:\/\/devilicious-pink.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/c90d\/i\/2015\/237\/0\/d\/steve_jobs_painting_by_devilicious_pink-d4c1qju.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Green"],"artist":"NekOTAKUBox","description":"Pride Month Green:Nature","medium":null,"title":"Nature's Aesthetic NekOTAKUBox Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride NekOTAKUBox #light #nature #tree #digitalpainting #naturelandscape #pridemonth2017","url":"https:\/\/nekotakubox.deviantart.com\/art\/Nature-s-Aesthetic-685571868\/?purchase=print&itemids=85","tags":["Community Projects","Awareness","2017","Pride"],"filename":"Nature's Aesthetic NekOTAKUBox Watch Community Projects Awareness 2017 Pride NekOTAKUBox #light #nature #tree #digitalpainting #naturelandscape #pridemonth2017_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$7.67","artistURL":"https:\/\/nekotakubox.deviantart.com\/","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/57ca\/i\/2017\/160\/a\/4\/nature_s_aesthetic_by_nekotakubox-dbc66n0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," White"],"artist":"NikySHouse","description":"Mouette is here in order to deliver a message from me: I wish you all HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!","medium":null,"title":"Happy Holidays!!!

Amir and Cam\/Kamil practically tie, i ADORE them.
