Also known as \"Tulipomania\". These two works represent (to plagiarise Wikipedia) what is considered to be the first recorded economic bubble: a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for tulip bulbs reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed. At the peak of tulip mania, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. The tulip painted here is the Semper Augustus, which was the most expensive tulip sold during tulip mania. I debated posting these as separate deviations, but they were created to be displayed together and I think need to be paired with eachother to make sense. This was a commission I completed before Christmas. It's something a bit different from my usual work, but I like when artists have several completely different styles nestled in amongst their gallery. There is a poster apparently featured in \"Wall Street 2\" in Michael Douglas's apartment where the event is mentioned. I don't know, I haven't seen the movie - but apparently economists all over the world want a poster of this event! And those that are currently available out there to my eyes look a bit underwhelming and are also quite expensive for a print. So this is my take on illustrating and depicting this event. I wanted it to look quite clean and simple, but still seem historical and Old-World enough. Hopefully it sits somewhere comfortably between looking contemporary and old. It was a bit of a challenge trying to produce that typical old botanical illustration aesthetic and approach to colour, but I think it's close (I couldn't help myself adding in a bit of purple to lift it a bit). For any typography nerds out there: the typeface I chose to hand draw is a more irregular variation on Caslon, which is derived from 17th Century Dutch Fell types typical of the era So there you are.

Bride is the daughter of the Dagda, and considered one of the Tuatha De Danann, the people of the Goddess Danu; She was especially associated with the province of Leinster, and was believed to protect the people there. Bride proved so popular that when Christianity came along they adopted Her into their pantheon as Saint Brigid, one of the three patron saints of Ireland; She was still, however, associated with fire and the province of Leinster. At Her convent in Kildare an eternal flame was kept lit.

I am old enough to have been a fan of \"Mork and Mindy\" from the 1970s and I have always enjoyed his comedy and more serious roles since then. He will be sadly missed. Acrylic on Deep Edge Canvas 40x30 inches This is a commission that I have just completed for a lovely young man from the USA. It is a surprise present for his wife, who loves the film \"What Dreams May Come\". I worked from various stills of the film to try and recreate the image that was required. The couple in the painting are him and his wife and she is carrying her favourite flowers, Calla lilies. It was wonderful to work on such a romantic gift. \"This was for me and it is BEYOND perfect. I can even express how amazing this gift is. I can't stop staring at it! You did so amazing - thank you SO SO much!\" (Message received when the gift was given.) \"As you can tell, we received the painting and my wife absolutely loves it. She said it was the best gift anyone had ever got her and that nothing would be able to top it. I'll be sure to send you a picture of it hanging once we do so. We are still trying to decide where we want it because my wife wants to put it in a place that she can look at it all the time. I just wanted to thank you for the amazing job you did with the painting. It turned out better than I could have imagined at the start and I am extremely happy that I found you and was able to have this work commissioned. It was a pleasure working with you and you made my first commission a very enjoyable process.\" (Message from client.) annmariebone.com Please like me on facebook My Facebook Page Thank you in advance for any comments and to anyone kind enough to add this painting to their collections.

The original black & white version is also available on this site, and I'll make the large, printable versions available soon too. I also have both in French (thanks to Arnaud Mousnier-Lompré's help). The map is PITT pen on various layers of tracing paper. The sketches were done in pencil on paper. Pieces were then scanned and printed on Canson paper, and painted with Ecoline ink. The background is a sheet of paper I kept in my jeans back pocket for a couple of weeks. Everything was then scanned again and assembled digitally. The font is Callie Hand by Callie Renee Roberson.

In business, kaizen refers to activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers. It also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain. It has been applied in healthcare, psychotherapy, life-coaching, government, banking, and other industries. By improving standardized programmes and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste. Kaizen was first practiced in Japanese businesses after the Second World War, influenced in part by American business and quality-management teachers, and most notably as part of The Toyota Way. It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside of business and productivity.","medium":null,"title":"KAIZEN Shodo Japanese Caligraphy carmenharada Watch Traditional Art Typography Calligraphy carmenharada #carmen #harada #japanese #kaizen #calligraphy","url":"https:\/\/carmenharada.deviantart.com\/art\/KAIZEN-Shodo-Japanese-Caligraphy-700649671\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Typography","Calligraphy"],"filename":"KAIZEN Shodo Japanese Caligraphy carmenharada Watch Traditional Art Typography Calligraphy carmenharada #carmen #harada #japanese #kaizen #calligraphy_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/carmenharada.deviantart.com\/","_id":"dtrad87","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/f700\/i\/2017\/236\/0\/5\/kaizen_shodo_japanese_caligraphy_by_carmenharada-dbl5cqv.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"StudioUndertheMoon","description":"The collection of oil paintings \" Sea \u201D 2016 www.facebook.com\/justynakopani\u2026","medium":null,"title":"Storm StudioUndertheMoon Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery StudioUndertheMoon #marine #painting #sea #seascape #storm","url":"https:\/\/studiounderthemoon.deviantart.com\/art\/Storm-646366076\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Landscapes & Scenery"],"filename":"Storm StudioUndertheMoon Watch Traditional Art Paintings Landscapes & Scenery StudioUndertheMoon #marine #painting #sea #seascape #storm_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/studiounderthemoon.deviantart.com\/","_id":"dtrad88","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/5ab6\/th\/pre\/i\/2016\/322\/6\/5\/storm_by_studiounderthemoon-daotv98.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Blue"," Black"],"artist":"agnes-cecile","description":"_never talk about it. watercolor, charcoal, ink.","medium":null,"title":"non parlarne mai agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Abstract agnes-cecile","url":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/art\/non-parlarne-mai-190095981\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Abstract"],"filename":"non parlarne mai agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Abstract agnes-cecile_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$55.75","artistURL":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/","_id":"dtrad89","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/dcde\/f\/2010\/353\/e\/f\/non_parlarne_mai_by_agnes_cecile-d356ezx.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"agnes-cecile","description":"> open parenthesis, close parenthesis I'm just a parenthesis in your life, here I've started, here I've finished. acrylic, watercolor, charcoal, pencil and pen on canvas 120cm x 80cm YOUTUBE | TUMBLR | FACEBOOK","medium":null,"title":"( ) agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal agnes-cecile","url":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/art\/--460309621\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Surreal"],"filename":"( ) agnes-cecile Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal agnes-cecile_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$55.75","artistURL":"https:\/\/agnes-cecile.deviantart.com\/","_id":"dtrad90","imgsrc":"https:\/\/orig00.deviantart.net\/9c6b\/f\/2014\/163\/2\/1\/parentesi_1_pic_by_agnes_cecile-d7m216d.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" White"," White"],"artist":"Melonkitten","description":"hello I felt like drawing blueberries have a nice day Van Gogh watercolor on Canson paper p.s. my first melonkitten book is available on Etsy (www.etsy.com\/de\/listing\/188048\u2026 or via mail to melonkitten@hotmail.de","medium":null,"title":"blueberry Melonkitten Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual","url":"https:\/\/melonkitten.deviantart.com\/art\/blueberry-465364385\/?purchase=print&itemids=181","tags":["Traditional Art","Drawings","Illustration","Conceptual"],"filename":"blueberry Melonkitten Watch Traditional Art Drawings Illustration Conceptual_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$58.57","artistURL":"https:\/\/melonkitten.deviantart.com\/","_id":"dtrad91","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/97e8\/i\/2014\/184\/c\/8\/blueberry_by_melonkitten-d7p2dgh.jpg","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Green"," Yellow"],"artist":"lunadarko","description":"aqua oil on wood;

Many of those paintings include a \u201Ctwisted perspective\u201D in which the undersides of the feet are shown. In a single image, those artists of old accurately showed what the animals looked like and the tracks they would leave, producing the earliest nature guides. In a similar abstract style, this painting depicts a current North American animal, the Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus), with its feet twisted upward to show its tracks. I also included some realistic full-size tracks, which are based on my plaster casts from the actual local animals here in southern California. (see also my YouTube channel video youtu.be\/I16PPjydSOE) This work is an original acrylic painting that I designed and hand painted on a 12 inch by 24 inch ceramic tile. The design is based on my many years of studying our native animals and their tracks. Like the handprints found in European caves, I signed this artwork with my \u201Chandprint,\u201D which includes my initials RCM.","medium":null,"title":"Prehistoric Style Mule Deer painting RobertMeyer Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals RobertMeyer #cave #deer #mule #nature #painting #prehistoric #tracks","url":"https:\/\/robertmeyer.deviantart.com\/art\/Prehistoric-Style-Mule-Deer-painting-652406297\/?purchase=print&itemids=24","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Animals"],"filename":"Prehistoric Style Mule Deer painting RobertMeyer Watch Traditional Art Paintings Animals RobertMeyer #cave #deer #mule #nature #painting #prehistoric #tracks_image.png","size":"12x18","price":"$28.79","artistURL":"https:\/\/robertmeyer.deviantart.com\/","_id":"dtrad99","imgsrc":"https:\/\/pre00.deviantart.net\/3703\/th\/pre\/f\/2016\/355\/a\/5\/a59af9fe7724d22bf8e00c3a95c0d141-dasfbx5.png","views":null,"likes":null},{"color":[" Black"," Black"],"artist":"borda","description":"oil on canvas 50x70cm","medium":null,"title":"In my dreams you always bring me to the Moon... borda Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal borda #adrian #bear #borda #girl #love #moon #moonrise #oil #oniric #painting #romania #surreal #teddy #teddybear #dreamworks (show more)","url":"https:\/\/borda.deviantart.com\/art\/In-my-dreams-you-always-bring-me-to-the-Moon-572136552\/?purchase=print&itemids=185","tags":["Traditional Art","Paintings","Surreal"],"filename":"In my dreams you always bring me to the Moon... borda Watch Traditional Art Paintings Surreal borda #adrian #bear #borda #girl #love #moon #moonrise #oil #oniric #painting #romania #surreal #teddy #teddybear #dreamworks (show more)_image.jpg","size":"12x18","price":"$50.05","artistURL":"https:\/\/borda.deviantart.com\/","_id":"dtrad100","imgsrc":"https:\/\/img00.deviantart.net\/59a9\/i\/2015\/318\/4\/e\/in_my_dreams_you_always_bring_me_to_the_moon____by_borda-d9gmve0.jpg","views":null,"likes":null}]
